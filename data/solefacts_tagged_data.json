Marketed as a fast shoe for \u201chigh speed interval training\u201d with 46mm stack height & 8mm drop. Plate positioning is hard to tell from the pictures but appears to sit low which is interesting, likely providing more stability than pop if this is the actual configuration. ",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/u00hiigcy44f1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e25ed6341dd60f8f5985866a5109c9ed892fcad1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lsoshr1ey44f1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6af9b353183a608bcbad8f309c47f1b842dbfffc\n\nI have 300 miles on the road version of the Salomon Aero Glide 3 (including a 50k, a marathon, and several 20-30 mile long runs) and recently attended two demo runs to try out the GRVL version (\\~10 miles total), so I thought I\u2019d create a write-up mostly about the road version and add some notes toward the end of the post about the GRVL version\u2019s slight differences.\n\n**About me:**\n\nFemale, 5\u20197\u201d, 150 pounds, 50-75 miles per week, heel striker, less than ideal running form, paces in the 8:30-11:00/mi pace range on road/light trail.\n\n**General shoe description:**\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s like the Saucony Triumph 20 and Nike Invincible had a baby, but lighter. I loved my several pairs of Triumph 20s (and 21s) because they were workhorses with a smooth ride and ideal cushion level. I loved my Nike Invincibles because they were bouncy and fun, but protective. The Salomon Aero Glide 3 is the best combination of these two shoes - smooth ride, goldilocks cushion, maximal protection on long runs, *and* bounce - but lighter. Noticeably lighter.\u00a0\n\n**Fit:**\u00a0\n\nThe fit on these shoes is not quite standard. They do run long, as many have stated, but not so long that I felt I needed to size down. I stuck to my standard size and it has worked out well, especially for longer runs. I just tighten the laces. The upper is baggy too. It doesn\u2019t impact how my foot feels, but it does look a little funny.\n\nSome shoe nerds may notice I am wearing a men\u2019s colorway. I just liked it better and crossed my fingers that they wouldn\u2019t be too wide when I ordered it online. Later, while attending the GRVL demo, I learned that *these shoes are unisex fit,* according to the Salomon reps. I tried on both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s to confirm for myself. I have a slightly narrow foot and did find these wider than other Salomon shoes I have tried on, but not too wide. But, I do have my laces tied pretty tight.\n\nAll around, this shoe is just slightly bigger than one would think it would be at a given size, but again, this does not bother me. I do not think it is worth sizing down.\u00a0\n\n**Running Feel/Ride:**\n\nOn my first run in it, I said out loud, \u201cThis is my new favorite shoe,\u201d and I meant it. \n\nThe ride is bouncy, but stable.\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t notice much of a rocker feel. It\u2019s similar to the Triumph 20/21\u2019s rocker. I like that, but it might be a downfall in the mind of some runners.\n\nThe cushion level is my ideal level of cushion\u2026 not a sinking in feeling, but a soft, stable cushion. The best part about the cushion is that it does not bottom out. As stated before, I ran in these for a 50k race (gravel), marathon (road), and several various terrain 20-30 mile runs. My feet felt protected the whole way through. I do notice the bounce less over longer runs though.\n\nI haven\u2019t tried to push pace in these much. I am running long runs and recovery runs in them. Though they are light for being a max cushion shoe, I can\u2019t see them being great for pace pickups. These shoes excel in the long run realm.\u00a0\n\n**Durability:**\n\nI have 300 miles on my pair and they still feel well-cushioned and bouncy. There is some wear and tear on the bottom, but nothing crazy (see photo above). If anything, I am noticing less wear than I have in other shoes I own at this milage. I suspect I'll take this to \\~450-500 miles.\n\n**Using the road version on gravel & light dirt trails:**\n\nI have been using the road version on gravel and dirt trails primarily. I have maybe \\~\u2153 of the 300 miles on road, and the rest on gravel or dirt trails. I have noticed no problems with this. The cushion level is such that I am not feeling rocks under foot, the shoe is stable even across roots and such, etc. However, I do think the GRVL version would be slightly better for these use cases. I will talk about that later in the post.\u00a0\n\nA positive worth noting related to trails and such - this shoe sheds mud like crazy. I went through a super muddy trail and after I got out of the mud, I could see the mud sliding off the shoes. Even the fabric parts of the upper! The shoes looked almost fully clean by the end of the run. I have never seen a shoe do that before. It dries fast too.\n\nThe grip is solid in the road version. I am a PNW\u2019er and have used this in the rain more than I have used it in the sun. The only time I have slipped a little was in the mud. The GRVL version\u2019s grip is likely better for muddy situations.\n\n**Using the GRVL version on road:**\n\nI\u2019ll give a short, general run down of the GRVL version toward the end of the post, but wanted to make a quick note here about using the GRVL version on the road. In the demo runs, we ran on roads to get to trails. I didn\u2019t notice any difference between the road and GRVL version on roads.\u00a0\n\n**Slight annoyances**:\u00a0\n\nThe road version makes a sound when running, especially on the road. It\u2019s like it\u2019s suctioning to the ground? I can\u2019t quite describe it. This is not something I noticed with the GRVL version. It doesn\u2019t bother me, but I thought I would mention it in case others are more sensitive to this sort of thing.\u00a0\n\nAlso, the laces are slippery. I have to double knot them every run or they are untied within 20 minutes.\n\n**Road vs GRVL version:**\u00a0\n\nAs stated before, I have 300 miles on the road version across a variety of terrains, and recently went to two demo runs to test the GRVL version for a total of \\~10 miles, also on a variety of terrains.\u00a0\n\nI did not notice any difference in fit between the two, nor did I notice a difference in feel or ride.\u00a0\n\nThe reps said the main difference between the two is that the outsole is hardier, which makes the shoe slightly heavier (I did not notice a weight difference on foot) but grippier and with more protection/less ground feel (ground feel is *not* a problem in the road shoe, but a little more protection certainly can\u2019t hurt).\u00a0\n\nThe other difference is the tongue. The road version doesn\u2019t have a plush tongue, but plusher than the GRVL version. It has an odd shape that makes it stick out from the foot, practically inviting debris in. The GRVL version is sock-like to keep gravel and other things out. I prefer the tongue on the GRVL version.\u00a0\n\nIf I were to order this shoe again (and I think I will), I would order the GRVL version, simply because both shoes *feel* the same, but the GRVL version is just slightly hardier. I don\u2019t think wearing down the outsole of the GVRL version on roads would be super problematic because there aren\u2019t really deep lugs, just a thicker outsole in general.\u00a0\n\n**Overall:**\n\nThe Salomon Aero Glide 3 makes an amazing long run shoe across a variety of terrains. The GRVL version is simply a hardier version.",

      "I intend to get the GRVL version of this probably around September - my usual loop is about half road, half tarot week maintained paths, but they can get really get wet and slippy after a bout of rain.  They've reviewed so well, glad to see they're doing well 300 miles in."

      "Just got the Mizuno Neo Vista from Fleet Feet. Took them out for a first run, just under 5 miles. \n\nMostly good, although around mile 4 could tell a blister was developing around my big toe (feetures light cushion tab socks). Not sure if this is due to the sock upper/lockdown, or them being slightly narrow. Hope as I get more mileage, the upper is able to loosen a little. Saw some people say the upper was a little sloppy/folded over itself/hard to get on, but I had no issues. Fits my foot like a sock (although I have to be mindful not to tie too tightly, towards the end of the run had a slight feeling just above the tongue that I had not experienced before. Picked up the pace and it went away).",

      "I got a pair of Ride 18s recently using a 20% off REI coupon. At first unboxing and try-on, I really thought I was going to love these. The Triumph 20s were my first real pair of running shoes (300+ miles and going strong). I tried the Ride 15 around that same time which came out the same year as the Triumph 20s IIRC, but they were way too firm for me and more importantly, really narrow compared to the Triumphs. I ended up returning them.\n\nThe Ride 18s actually have a wider base than my Triumph 20s, both in the same size (7 2E; I have small but fat hobbit feet). The upper is extremely plush, also reminiscent of the Triumphs, and with the update to PWRRUN PB, I thought the Ride 18s were going to be the spiritual successor to my Triumphs.\n\n4 miles into my run, my left foot went completely numb, something that's never happened to me before with any shoe. I stopped to loosen the laces which helped momentarily, but I knew that it would happen again if I kept running. I also felt my pinky toe \"rolling over\"; clearly the shoes were too narrow for me despite having a larger base than my Triumphs. My best guess is that it's something with the upper construction/material that's giving me issues. Speaking of the upper, these things are **toasty**. The Triumphs are already toasty enough but these felt even sweatier.\n\nIf I could do it all over again I'd probably go up half a size, but at that point I'm pushing the boundaries of the shoes being too long. I think I am just going to return these and pick up another pair of NB Rebel v4s while they are on sale still. New Balance just fits my hobbit feet so much better than any other brand and I guess this is one of those times when I should just stick to what I know is tried and true for me.\n\nSide note, I also bought a pair of ES4s since they were on sale in size 7.5 (half size up from my normal 2E size, but they only make these in regular width). I am most certainly going to return those after my experience with the Rides since they are even more narrow.",

      "I'm just here to say that Superblast 2 truly is the goat shoes for me. If I can only choose a single shoe for a full year of running i'll choose this.\n\nI've never had so much fun and versatility in a single shoe ever. This is the fastest i've had a shoe go to 200km and it actually still looks like new. I think at this rate i can use this shoe until around 1000km+",
      "Heads up that as of today, 6/1, the Novablast 5 is going up $10 to $150. The price has been updated on the Asics website, but (as of now), it is still sitting at $140 on some retailer\u2019s websites (such as fleet feet)",
      "Recently tried the Nimbus 27. Super soft with a wide toe box. I\u2019m not a scientist, but I think they\u2019re causing my shin splints. They weigh a ton.",
      "I have wide feet and a super low arch, and pronate. I was recommended stability running shoes, so I went with Gel-Kayano 31s. I love running in them, especially the wide front sole.\n\nAm I only bound to the Gel-Kayanos as a stability shoe? I feel limited, not being able to run in Superblasts, or Novablasts, and all the other neutral running shoes, just because they\u2019re a more neutral shoe, rather than a stability shoe. I want to experience the extra cushion those other running shoes provide.",
      "Super happy with the release of the Kayano 32, but as an European I\u2019m bummed about the colourways we got. My top 3 is piedmont grey/gravel, oatmeal/meteor grey and completely white. Unfortunately neither of these are available on this side of the world."

      "I\u2019m really enjoying the EVO SL and currently building up toward half marathon distance - my longest run so far is 18km. I\u2019m now looking for a more stable shoe to complement the EVO SL as they start to feel a little mushy and indirect after an hour. \n\nI tend to get along well with Adidas shoes in terms of fit so I\u2019m considering either the Boston 12, which is currently quite affordable here in the UK at around \u00a3100, or the Adios Pro 4, though it's twice the price.\n\nFor reference, I recently tried the Saucony Endorphin Pro 4 but didn\u2019t like the fit at all.",

I'm racing in the Boston 12 and looking for a replacement, that also functions as Tempo Shoe and also some intervals down to 5k pace (4:00/km). My Longrun/easy day shoes are the Primas.\n\nWhich would you choose: B13 or EVO sl? No real stability needs, racing only 10k and halves."

    "selftext": "[Salomon's Aero Glide 3 eTPU based Energy Foam EVO midsole paired with a gravel specific outsole](https://preview.redd.it/u43gr0lmf04f1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90fc16fc4ee499fca194d7a4bdf23b1494275e5f)\n\n**RUNNING SHOE GEEK:** EU 43 (US Men's 10), 175 cm (5'9\u201d), 68 kg (149 lbs)\n\n**DISTANCE RAN TO DATE:** 82K on crushed limestone as well as Lake Michigan shoreline shingle\n\n**USE CASE:** A decade ago, gravel began to take off as a subset of cycling. Bridging the gap between road cycling and mountain biking, gravel has grown in popularity with its own races, gear, clubs, websites, etc. That is now carrying over into the running world. Whereas trail running tends to focus on forest single track & rocky mountain ridges and road running is all about pounding pace on pavement, gravel combines the best of both worlds. We are now seeing an evolution of the road-to-trail segment of running shoes geared toward a growing interest in gravel and bolstered by the post-pandemic explosion of ultramarathoning.\n\n**REASON FOR BUYING:** Upcoming gravel ultramarathons in South Dakota, Michigan, and Kansas, where I will benefit from a non-plated, max-cushioned shoe with high energy return, light weight, and a durable outsole. I am using this shoe as a daily trainer on gravel trails as well as the late-race shoe in my aid station drop bag.\n\n**OVERALL:**\n\n* Built for comfort first and foremost rather than speed or stability.\n* This is a shoe for long miles on non-technical terrain, gravel & sand, without significant hazards.\n* Surprisingly light for a trail shoe at 270g (9.5 ounces) for an EU 43 (US Men's 10)\n* Max cushioned shoe with a medium-high drop at 40mm in the heel and 32mm in the forefoot\n* The shoe does not have a plate, carbon or otherwise.\n* Reasonably priced at $160 USA/\u00a3145 UK/\u20ac160 EU\n\n**SIZING:** Slightly long for size. If unsure, go a half size down.\n\n**UPPER:**\n\n* Comfortable but thick and hot, particularly around the heel collar.\n* The mesh upper takes in water easily and, unfortunately, holds it in.\n* Standard-height heel collar with no built-in gaiter. You may want a gaiter on sand or gravel.\n* Standard flat laces rather than Salomon's polarizing Quicklace system.\n* Long, thick, and fully gusseted neoprene tongue. Zero chance of lace bite.\n* Rubber extension of the outsole serves as a toecap for gravel. Not adequate for big rocks or roots.\n* Characteristic of the brand, the midfoot runs narrow. The toe box is ample, but not Topo generous.\n\n**MIDSOLE:**\n\n* Surprisingly lightweight and bouncy due to the use of supercritical TPU foam.\n* The foot sinks into the soft midsole, providing a cradling effect. No break-in period needed.\n* Very cushy, soft shoe with a feel remarkably similar to the original ZoomX in the Nike Invincible.\n* The 8mm drop provides some forward propulsion, but no aggressive rocker. Not a speed shoe.\n* The lack of a carbon plate means no added stability on uneven surfaces given the high stack.\n* An exposed midsole on the bottom of the shoe may impact long-term durability. No rock plate.\n\n**OUTSOLE:**\n\n* Short 2mm chevron lugs with waffle lugs on the center forefoot.\n* This outsole is intentionally built for crushed gravel, shingle, and sand.\n* The short lugs allow for a pleasant ride on pavement.\n* This outsole is inadequate for mud.\n* The U-shaped outsole design provides for a more flexible shoe but also impacts stability.\n* The recessed center outsole provides greater control on sand and smooth shingle.\n* Salomon's ContraGrip rubber provides adequate, not outstanding, grip on wet surfaces.\n* Like most trail shoes, this shoe accepts pull-on winter traction devices well.\n\n**COMPARISON: If** there had been a trail version of the Nike Invincible 1, it would have been the Salomon Aero Glide 3 GRVL.",

      "So, I think the natural inclination is going to be to look at this shoe and think of the Nike Free-dominated barefoot era, but that\u2019s not what this is. \n\nIt has a 36-30 stack. The Glycerin 23 will have a 38-30 stack for reference. The Flex isn\u2019t a minimal shoe, it\u2019s a max-cushion shoe, with flexibility. \n\nThere is a segment of runners who are rejecting the stiff, max-cushion + rocker combo. They are asking for something cushioned but flexible and there\u2019s not much out there. \n\nThis is a cushioned, stable, take on flexibility. Basically, as Carson Caprara said, what if we took the insight of the barefoot moment 10 years ago, but did it with better foams and more support.",
      "Reminds me a of the Aroura BL outsole with the segmented flex areas. Very cool to see some of the design language and technology from the BL series bleeding into their more traditional shoes",
      "The Brooks rep brought one of these in to a store I work at a couple of weeks ago. I think they're aiming for something like the old Nike Free Run. They're incredibly flexible, the upper felt amazing but they just felt a bit 'meh' underfoot. They're demanding a pretty big price tag too, more than a Glycerin if I remember right.",

    "title": "Li-Ning Red Hare 8 Pro",
    "selftext": "A little about me. I'm a 44 year old male 5'8, 65kg  mid to forefoot striker who has run on and off since I was about 11 years old, although I never really trained with any purpose in the past, and in my teenage years just played alot of different sports and ran cross country on the weekend with a club. I really only ran shorter distances and teenage me ran a 19:05 5km personal best. After 12 years of no running or sports due to IT band and plantar fascia issues I got back into it last August and am focusing on my first marathon later this year, and recently ran a 46:39 10km during a 14.5km race. \n\nI've just added the Li-ning Red Hare 8 Pro to my daily non plated shoes rotation alongside my Asics Novablast 4, Puma Magmax and Adidas Evo SL. \n\nThe Red Hare 8 Pro is a really nice looking and well put together shoe. The fit is somewhat narrow through the midfoot and forefoot compared to the heel, but using a runners knot I have no issues with heel lift. As with all running shoes I get whatever size is a 260 measurement which can equate to different US sizes and it's usually the perfect fit and this shoe is no different. I haven't weighed mine, but they state a US 8.5 to be 230g.\n\nThe upper is a softish thin mesh which they call boom fiber. It is constructed by spinning a thermoplastic elestomer into a lightweight material. It seems soft, breathable and lightweight. The heel is quite structured and has excellent support with a plastic cup like structure around the heel on the outside of the shoe. \nThe tongue while not gusseted is well padded and maybe on the long and wide side, but I had no issue with any movement. \n\nBoom midsole tech although not specified, I understand is a supercritical beaded peba or peba like foam. \nThe Red Hare 8 Pro is a full slab of this supercritical foam, whereas the 7 Pro was a 2 layer midsole with an EVA bottom. \nThe 8 Pro has increased the stack height and it's a mid height stack at 27mm in the forefoot and 35mm in the heel for an 8 mm drop. For additional structure and torsion control there is a plastic shank in the midsole (similar to the Evo SL). \n\nThe outsole coverage and tread looks fine and is a rubber compound. Time will tell how durable it is but I have had no issue on wet surfaces. \n\nI've taken them out so far for only 2 runs, an 8km and 10km easy run. Each time at around 5:30 per km pace, and they just work. \nI admire how this shoe feels nimble and kind of just melts into the background and just let's you run. It feels natural. \nThe midsole has a nice little squish and rebound. It's by no means a propulsive feeling particularly being a mid height stack and having no plate. But  the shoe gives a nice feedback from the midsole and just keeps your legs ticking over.\n\nIn comparison I find the Novablast 4 for me as a short, lightweight person to be a non responsive midsole with a sloppy fit and just too much heel for my footstrike. \nMy Magmax though I really like. Still probably too much heel and girth in the midsole for my liking but the fit is fantastic and the midsole rebound of the nitro foam is killer. \n\nIn conclusion, the Red Hare 8 Pro is a fantasticly well built well designed and high tech shoe that is dirt cheap. I bought it from Taobao delivered to Australia for a total of $82 AUD. And have seen it on Aliexpress for not much more. It's a great addition to a daily non plated rotation, complements my rotation and gives me a chance to get away from the never ending max stacks! ",

    "title": "Adidas Adizero SL2: 300km Review",
    "selftext": "**Total distance ran:** 344 km ( 214 miles)\n\n**Type of runs:** Daily training: easy runs mostly, as well as intervals. One or two tempo runs before I got a tempo/race shoe.\n\n**Weather ran in:** Sunny, some after-rain, wet road, indoor.\n\n**My profile:**\n\nHeight: 168cm (5'6\")\n\nWeight: 73kg (161 lbs)\n\nRange of average pace with this shoe: 9:55 min/km (6:10 min/mile)\n\n**Strike Type:** Midfoot\n\nAverage runs a week 25km (15.5 miles).\n\n**Positives:**\n\n* Stable\n* Very cushiony upper and midsole\n* Full-length Lightstrike Pro layer drastically improves comfort and responsiveness vs previous version\n* Better upper compared to the previous version\n\n**Negatives:**\n\n* Poor outsole durability compared to previous version\n* Adidas laces (as always) need to be double-knotted or they will come untied\n\n**Overview:**\n\nI bought these shoes to replace my Adizero SL as my daily trainer. At the time, I had only just started a shoe rotation, and my daily trainer was my do-it-all workhorse. The SL 2 has been mostly my 2-3 easy runs per week and some intervals, depending on the distance/speed of the intervals and/or the quantity.\n\nAs they've broken in, I've noticed the LightStrike Pro feels less squishy underfoot when walking, but is still every bit as well-cushioned and springy when running as the first time I put them on, if not more so. The LightStrike 2.0 surrounding the LS Pro adds some stability without taking anything away from the LS Pro's energy return. The combination of foams in this shoe keeps my feet fresh for all of my daily runs. I think it has been a big help in extending both my running speed and distance as I set a PR in my most recent 5K race, and as I prepare to take on my first 10K in July.\n\nI really appreciate the revised padding in the heel cup, the way it hugs the ankle at the opening of the shoe, but is thin and out of the way down by the heel itself. This seems to make the inside of the shoe less prone to wearing and breaking down over time. The tongue is more padded than the previous version, drastically reducing lace-bite, which is great for me as I like a very secure lockdown on my heel. Overall, this shoe is definitely geared toward keeping your feet comfortable during your daily runs.\n\nThe upper itself is very breathable, and the new holes in the insole assist with breathability as well, I have significantly less sweaty feet than I used to. The toebox seems to be designed with better durability in mind. While I'm sure that not being on top of nail trimming was a significant cause for tearing through uppers in shoes previous, with this line of shoes, I will note that in the previous version, the upper tore where the knit material met and gave way to a thin rubber-like coating. The upper in the SL2 is a consistent knit across the entirety of the toebox and seems to be more resilient.\n\nI wish I could end it there, saying nothing but good about this honestly fantastic trainer, but alas, no shoe is without fault...\n\nLet's talk about oustole rubber. Adidas chose not to use Continental rubber for this shoe, presumably to make this shoe more affordable as your daily trainer is likely your most used, and thusly most quickly/often replaced shoe. The issue here is it's durability and longevity. [As Believe in the Run's Cut-in-Half review pointed out](https://runrepeat.com/adidas-adizero-sl2), the rubber on this version is actually *less durable* than the previous version. I see often in different running subs runners talk about their superfoams dying or losing their responsiveness. I have to say, with this shoe, I'm afraid I will burn through the rubber before the foam has reached its end of life, as indicated by the hotspots pointed out on my right shoe. Some small portions of those ridges has completely worn down to the base rubber already around the cutouts.\n\nAnother issue, although easily fixable if desired is Adidas' flat laces. I like them overall for what they are. The little bit of stretch allows you to really lock your foot down without making yourself to prone to lace bite. But something about Adidas laces just makes them \\*always\\* come untied. Double-knotting is a must if you plan to keep the default laces.\n\n**Worth buying?:**\n\nYes. Even with my concerns, I absolutely feel that this shoe has enriched my running experience, and if need be, I will purchase another pair (although I would like to see Adidas produce an SL3). They are often on sale too which makes them all the more worth every penny.",

      "Just want to share this: don\u2019t feel confined to shoes recommendations, try different shoes if possible. \n\nA bit back ground: I started running regularly about 20 years ago. Not hardcore, just 3-6mi max. I went to a Road Runner store, and they measured my feet etc. and recommended New Balance 767 and/or ASICS GT-2120 which were stability shoes. So since then I've been wearing mainly stability shoes, even NB 993, and as of just before COVID time I was actually wearing NB 860v2 from 2012. Fast-forward to 2023, I bought a pair of Nimbus 25. Like the shoes a lot, but they felt a bit numb. I started trying neutral/lighter shoes and found that after all I don't really need big, stability shoes. Cushions is nice, but I could go firmer without hurting my feet and knees much more, which was the reason I stuck with more stable shoes to begin with.\n\nConclusion is: even if you got recommendations from running shoes stores, try different types of shoes. Some stores/brands have really good return policy, so as long as you don't abuse them, take advantage of them.",
      "Just bought my first super shoes the other day. Bought the Wave Rebellion Pro 2. Just tried them on and they feel interesting, hopefully they feel better running in them than walking. I\u2019m worried I will roll my ankle in these as I\u2019ve sprained each of my ankles multiple times since I was a kid. Any tips I should be aware of? I train in Mizuno Wave Inspire 12 and Mizuno Wave Legacy 28. Should I find a better trainer?",
      "Looking for a shoe recommendation - I'm starting to build a shoe rotation after building up to 30km a week wearing Topo Ultrafly 5s for all my runs. I generally like them as I have high arches, but the low drop is a bit tough on my calves.\n\nAfter walking the Camino de Santiago Portuguese Route (\\~270km) in Hoka Speedgoat 6s a few weeks back, I've been experiencing a lot of achilles discomfort on the right side. My physio cleared me to start running again and I've just been doing 5ks every other day for the last week, and it's not painful during my runs but the next day I have some achilles pain and tightness. So, looking for a shoe that would be helpful in managing that. \n\n  \nMy physio had previously recommended a low drop shoe, but I can't quite remember why, or whether she said they would be better for me specifically. I have a labral in my left hip (strength training has helped a lot), so not sure if that was the reason.\n\n  \nAny help would be much appreciated!",
      "Does the heel of the adios pro 4 heel feel like it crumbles and cups the heel on impacts on anyone else, should I have sized down?",
      "Currently have adidas sl 1 but find it i have pain while running. Also have nike pegasus and find it lacking cushioning.\n\nLooking to spend big (but not too big) now instead of buying shoes on sale. Looking at NB 1080 v14 or NB Fresh foam x v5. I'm a slow running and I'm not having a good time with my running right now because of the pain. Before that I had a puma deviate nitro and I've run 400km before the cushioning was gone."

      "First run with Mizuno Neo Vista:\n\n13km with progressive repeats at uptempo paces:\n\n- 2.5km easy run\n- 2km at 4:55/km\n- 2km at 4:45/km\n- 2.5km at 5:10/km\n- 2km at 4:55/km\n- 2km at 4:45/km\n\nThis by the book the ideal run for the EVO SL. But I wanted to test the NV for longish runs at varying paces as it seems to be quite a bit of contradictory opinions on their tempo capabilities.\n\nThe fit feels like a glove. Snug, no heel slippage or any discomfort. I think this is the shoe that fits my feet the best.\n\nThe first surprise is that it feels way lighter on the feet than what I would expect.\n\nThey\u2019re comfortable at easy slow paces 6:00-6:15/km. \nWhen I tried to pick up the paces took me longer to reach the pace than with the EVO SL, there is no aggressive rocker here and the shoe doesn\u2019t push you as much to pick up the pace.\nBUT when I hit the pace it is very easy to lock it and forget about it.\n\nThese shoes seems to work very well for my gait, landing on mid/forefoot. And all the bounciness that you feel at slower paces turns into a nice firmer and surprisingly responsive (the plate?) ride.\n\nI ended running the last km (meant to be at 4:45/km) at 4:19. \n\nAlso, I had quite beat up legs this week (yesterday I was in agony doing an easy run with the Adizero SL2) and today\u2019s run with the NV ended with my legs feeling like new. So massive plus here for the NV.\n\nVery happy with them!",
      "Topo Athletic Phantom 4\n\nRan 3 miles and 4 miles so far in them.\n\nVery comfortable and good cushion as well. However, the cushion isn\u2019t too soft where it feels like you\u2019re on clouds. It has the right amount of firmness on this shoe. The best thing about it is the foot shaped toe box which makes it great for wide footers. I never really had a foot shape toe box before and was kinda skeptical because it looks goofy. But, since running in these I think I may have to come back to Topo in the future",
      "The North Face Vectiv Enduris 4\n\n2 runs so far. About 16 miles. Lovely Dream Foam. Firm and responsive. Good for trail setting. Vectiv line has substantial toe spring. Really rolls you thru the stride. Great breathability. Excellent stability. Seems great until you get to more than moderately technical where the rocker would be less ideal. Love them so far. Great compliment to my Mafate Speed 4 which I would trust more in technical settings.",

The sole puts my foot strike in forefoot position and at slower paces or prolonged use my feet would get uncomfortable. It did not cause blisters or toe pinching or anything, and I found the fit to be a bit large in the toe box but my foot didn\u2019t slide around too much.\n\nOverall I like using these shoes for 5km runs at fast paces.\n\nHave a great weekend!",

They're not for sale on the Adidas website and I can't find any details about the official release date. (Notoriously wrong) Solereview claims a June release.\n\nOn a related note, I've either been under a rock or Adidas is ineffective at marketing the revamped Supernova line. I've been rotating the SL2/Boston 12 for the past year, but the introduction of the Evo SL made the SL2 redundant for me and I wanted something more stable and cushioned for easy runs. It seems the Prima is similar to the Triumph/Vomero/etc., but I didn't even know it existed.",

    "title": "First Run Impression: Skechers SKX Aero Tempo",
    "selftext": "Context: 40M, 195 lb/88 kg, midfoot striker, neutral/slight supination, 24.5-minute 5K, 2-hour half\n\nI recently posted a first-run review of the Skechers SKX Aero Burst\u2014Skechers Performance\u2019s new max-cushion trainer (successor to the Max Road series). That shoe was love at first run, and I\u2019m happy to report that the two weeks since then have endeared that shoe to me even more. It\u2019s my absolute favorite shoe at the moment, and I\u2019ve run it at varying paces and for varying distances with uniformly great results.  My wife also picked up a pair and is similarly obsessed with them.\n\nAnyway, I was asked by (at least) a dozen people if I\u2019d picked up a pair of the Aero Tempo, the successor to the Alpha Tempo (formerly Speed Beast). Now, I\u2019m a massive Alpha Tempo fan\u2014I\u2019ve been running mine HARD for two years and they look literally brand new (and feel perfect). I\u2019ve even set a few lifetime PBs in them!\n\nSo that\u2019s why my answer to all those curious RunningShoeGeeks was \u201cI\u2019ll definitely pick up a pair of the Aero Tempo down the road, as my Alpha Tempos are still somehow running like new shoes.\u201d \n\nBut then a few days ago I just checked the Skechers site on a whim and saw the Aero Tempo was discounted 35%?! I also had like $30 of Skechers Points to use, so long story short: I bought a pair of the Aero Tempo for just over $100. I think it might\u2019ve been a glitch on the website or something, but that deal was too good to pass up.\n\nSo what do I think of these things, the newest members of the Skechers Performance Aero-aissance?\n\nMy initial run was a bread-and-butter sort of affair for shoes like this: tempo miles. I ran negative splits and threw some fartlek strides in there every once in a while.\n\nStep-in:\n\nMy very first impressions were that these shoes look significantly cooler in person than they do on the website. The coral really pops, and the anterior midsole is coated with a very pronounced iridescent purple. It also looks WEIRD. There\u2019s no other way to put it. The upper is a TPU mesh, and it really feels like it. Super light, but almost like someone cut out part of a traffic safety vest and made a shoe out of it. I\u2019m not even saying that\u2019s a bad thing\u2014again, I think these shoes look pretty sick\u2014but it\u2019s definitely weird.\n\nThe tongue and the lining around the heel is made of an extremely soft (like, *extremely* soft) suede-like material. It feels absolutely luxurious, and I\u2019d imagine these shoes would be quite comfortable to run in without socks (if you\u2019re the sort of nutcase who enjoys that). This is also where my main problems with the shoe started, but I\u2019ll hold off on that for a little bit.\n\nOn step-in, I actually GASPED because these shoes DO NOT HAVE ARCH FIT. Arch Fit has been the most consistently controversial thing in Skechers Performance shoes for forever. I\u2019ve always loved it\u2014I have moderately high arches, and I\u2019ve always found the support from Arch Fit insoles to be just as good as the aftermarket insoles I wear from my Marathon Sports fitting forever ago. These feel totally flat on the inside. I suspect most people will be really happy about this, but I personally will just swap the insoles with my aftermarket ones.\n\nAs soon as I got my feet in these puppies, I noticed what would be my biggest issue with them. Heel slippage. This has never been a problem for me in other shoes, but instantly I could detect it just walking around the house. I tied runner\u2019s knots and they mitigated the issue somewhat, but not completely. This is with socks on, and not particularly thin ones.\n\nThe fit is quite nice otherwise, about what I would expect for a \u201cracy\u201d shoe. On the narrow side, but not excessively so. Length is bang-on. Overall they fit true-to-size. \n\nWarm-up:\n\nHere\u2019s the thing with fast shoes: you don\u2019t expect much in the way of a heel counter. Typically that area is pretty flexible, and that\u2019s fine\u2014because typically manufacturers will pad the interior enough to keep your foot in place. Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case with these shoes. The benefit here is, of course, weight saving. And these are very nicely light shoes, noticeably lighter than the Boston 12, for example.\n\nBut one of the main physiological things you want to focus on during speed work is maintaining a slight forward lean to keep your center of mass over the feet, and I find it\u2019s really hard to do that if your heel is slipping out. So this was pretty annoying to me.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m going to come back with a full review of these in the coming months once I\u2019ve logged more miles, as I want to play around with some stuff to get a better fit. I quite like most other aspects of the shoe, and I\u2019d like to give them a full chance.\n\nThe rest of the warmup was OK, but I was struck by how different these feel compared to the Alpha Tempo. Similar to the whole Arch Fit thing, I think most runners will probably prefer this\u2014the Alpha Tempo is a strange shoe with a hyper-aggressive rocker and very unforgiving (but energetic) foam, so it was never a massive hit for Skechers. I love the ride of the Alpha Tempo though, as I feel it\u2019s really genuinely propulsive and sort of a riot to push hard in.\n\nThe Aero Tempo, though, is way more subdued out of the gate. I\u2019m surprised by this, honestly. This has a full-length carbon-infused plate, for one thing (the Alpha Tempo is forefoot-only). The Hyper Burst Pro in the Aero Tempo feels way closer to the Hyper Burst Ice in the Aero Burst than I was expecting. This is a much smoother, more forgiving ride than the Alpha Tempo was. I\u2019ve always found the Alpha Tempo feels genuinely bad going slowly (but incredible at tempo/threshold sort of stuff); the Aero Tempo definitely feels better at moderate paces than the Alpha Tempo\u2014almost like a daily trainer. \n\nThe run:\n\nMy first couple miles were honestly pretty damning. I was writing this review in my head, trying out stupid tag lines like \u201cAchilles\u2019 Heel,\u201d etc. But as I said, this was a negative-splits workout, and after a few more miles I started feeling a little differently about them. Once I opened my hips up and started really moving, the bouncy character of these shoes really started to shine. They are VERY well suited for tempo pace, which to be fair is what they are made for. Nice quick turnover, very bouncy, a lot more \u201ccomposed\u201d than the Alpha Tempo.\n\nThey didn\u2019t feel especially great at strides, for whatever reason. Something I love about the Razor in particular is it really shines at sprinting pace. I found the Aero Tempo didn\u2019t really want to go nuts, but rather kept wanting to get back to tempo.\n\nBut at that pace\u2014like right around 180 cadence\u2014they do feel great. Very neutral, very composed, great grip as always from the Goodyear outsole. The character overall is bouncy, fun, not particularly dramatic. It\u2019s a great shoe for a tempo run.\n\nI definitely wouldn\u2019t classify it as a \u201crace day\u201d shoe, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019d do just fine in something like a half-marathon. I probably wouldn\u2019t personally do a marathon in them, but we\u2019ll see if I change my tune in the coming months.\n\nWeight of my men\u2019s 10.5 is just a hair over 8 ounces. So slightly less than advertised!\n\nVerdict (for now\u2014I will revisit with a more thorough review eventually):\n\nI am excited to run more in these. I think they\u2019re a fantastic tempo day choice. They\u2019re comfortable, bouncy, and fun. I hope they feel a little better at variable speeds as they break in a little bit. I\u2019ll report back with updates. \n\nThe heel issue is a big one for me. If I can get that lockdown to work right (likely with bigger socks), I think I will enjoy the shoe a lot more in general.\n\nThey don\u2019t feel like the sort of shoe I would recommend to everyone (the Aero Burst is the epitome of that sort of shoe). But they do feel like a fun tool for faster (but not SUPER fast) days, and I\u2019m very pleased I was able to get them for so cheap.\n\nAnd I guess the fact that I\u2019m excited to run in them again is probably a good thing, right?",

    "title": "HOKA MACH X2 300 MI REVIEW",
    "selftext": "Hoka Mach X2 300 Mile Review\n\nAbout me:  48 yo Male, 6ft 180lbs FM 3:15, HM 1:31, 5K 19:00, 1MI 5:22, 40-60 miles per week.\n\nTHE SHOE: There is a TON of information on the specs including the stack height (46/41), drop (5mm), materials (Peba/SCEVA), etc. so I won't spend too much time boring you with all of that.  I had first purchased it last year as an upgrade to the Mach 5, but immediately returned it due to the heel tab issue.  Here was my initial review. After some convincing from friends, I repurchased it and used exclusively with Feetures Elite Max Cushion Tab socks.  Problem solved! I bought in my normal 11.5.\n\nTHE FIT:  As I stated, I had initially purchased these and returned them due to the heel collar giving me abrasions.  Once in the right socks, the fit was like magic.  I like the snug race-like upper.  It's breathable, light, and easy to wash (this is important). There was a little bit of a break-in period where I felt like my feet didn't quite sink into the shoe all the way, but after a few runs they felt fantastic.\n\nOUTSOLE:  I had seen some initial wear on the heels almost immediately within the first 50 miles or so.  At 300 miles you can see that the heel is pretty much worn through, but hasn't gotten much worse.  I'm not a heel striker per se, but I do run a LOT of hilly terrains where I often scuff these areas.  I will say that the outsole is super tacky with decent grip but the heel areas wore down pretty fast.  I'm still running in them, and have used a little shoe goo to elongate the life of the rubber, but kinda disappointing.  The forefoot looks pretty great with the exception of some of the rubber around the very top of the shoe.  Honestly, the rest of the outsole almost looks new.  I'm not sure why the heels have worn so quickly.  My other shoes generally wear in the font/forefoot.  Weird.\n\nMIDSOLE:  I have a lot of tempo and race shoes (EVO SL, Endo Speed/Pro 3&4, Alpha Fly 3, Superblast 1/2, Cielo X1, Rocket X2, Metaspeeds...) and can say this is by far the most balanced and poppy midsole I've tried for my paces.  It's the perfect balance of soft, bouncy, and snappy.  I'm glad I got the heel counter to work the 2nd go around.  I've used this shoe for everything from light trails, speed work, all out mile efforts, 400/800 meter workouts, long runs, easy runs et al.  I really don't want to run in anything else to be honest.  I see other reviews online for shoes I've tried or owned, and shake my head.  Every shoe midsole should be compared to this.  Yowana (whom I have mad respect for) recently added it to his GOAT list of shoes.  I'm telling you the midsole is pretty close to perfect (for my liking anyways).\n\nOVERALL PROS:  Basically the perfect midsole/ride.  Can handle all paces, but shines at tempo and race paces which for me is 7:30/mi down to 5:30/mile.  This shoe is absolute fire for speed work and long runs.  I also love the upper and overall look of the shoe on-foot.  It's easy to clean, and has zero signs the midsole is flattening out at 300 miles.  It's only gotten better with time.  I also like the colorways for this shoe.  The black/orange, red, and newer hews all look nice.\n\nOVERALL CONS:  Well the heel is an issue that will certainly be addressed in the next iteration.  Wear the right socks and it shouldn't be a problem.  FYI this shoe WILL NOT work with cotton socks.  You shouldn't wear those anyways IMO. The other thing I hope they improve is the heel outsole material.  Hoka, use the Rocket X2 outsole material next time.  I put 400 miles on the RX2 and the outsole barely had a scratch.\n\nCOMPARISONS:  I'd say the rocker is very similar to the Cielo X1, but for some reason the Mach X2 has an easier time picking up the pace.  It's not as voluminous or as soft/bouncy.  It's more snappy.  i'd say this shoe has a balance of softness and snappiness that you might get if you were to combine the Rocket X2 and the Cielo X1 or Adidas Pro 4.  The bottom layer of CEVA really adds balance to the soft Peba foam.  Hoka has a killer blend and rocker on this shoe.  The EVO SL also has that similar kind of soft/bouncy foam, but it doesn't handle speed nearly as well as the Mach X2.  The Mach X2 with the rocker and mixed foams is really amazing.\n\nRECOMMENDATION- I bought a second pair.  So I will obviously recommend this shoe.  I'd however wait for a discount as $190 isn't cheap, and the new version will likely be out by the end of summer.  If you can score a good discount, go for it.  Just wear proper socks.  I plan on taking this shoe to 400 miles before prying the new pair from the box.  I have a pretty solid rotation, but the Mach X2 is my favorite for most runs.  Other shoes I'm using include:  EVO SL for easy, Cielo X1 for long runs (13-22 miles) Challenger 7/Mafate for trails, and Brooks Glizzy Max for recovery.",

      "I second this, these are the only shoes I want to wear (vs. SB1, NB4, Zoom Fly 6, Deviate Nitro 2... though my Neo Vistas are a very close second and more useful for light work). Luckily I have never had the heel issue. (I was initially wearing KT tape on my heel just in case, but have since dropped that because I obviously forgot once and didn't bleed.)",
      "thanks for the review, i have the Cielo X1 V1, how would you compare it to the Cielo X1? i find the Cielo X1 makes me go faster than i want to and the lateral cut out and the heel is a tad unstable for me, esp on camber roads. thanks!",
      "Couldn't agree more! Bought a 10 pack of heel pads ($6 on Amazon) that I shoe gooed in place, no heel slip, no bleeding my own blood. Found a good deal ($120) and bought a second and third pair. It's the only shoe that can handle every run for me since the og ES1/2 - long, tempo, daily - all more fun in the MX2",
      "I got 200 miles in my pair, I like them and used them a lot for my long runs and aerobic miles. They\u2019re decently poppy, I thought they were a decent upgrade to my beat up ES3s, but I never found the Mach X2 to be comfortable and I always had heel slip, and sometimes my feet became numb"

Being first is never easy, but it went better than expected.  \n\n[The AMA is here for those who missed it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1kmqg54/topo_athletic_ama/)\n\n**Next up:**  \n**Adidas** joins the fray with **Simon Lockett**, Category Director for Global Running Footwear, who spearheads the **Evo SL**. This one should get you hyped and excited!  \n\n**When:**  \n**Tuesday, June 3rd | 5:00-6:00 PM CET**  \n*(Global timings below)*  \n\n**Who:**  \n- **Simon Lockett** (Category Director, Global Brands Running Product Footwear)  \n- **You** (The people who\u2019ve made it their new favourite trainer)  \n\n**Focus:**  \nThis AMA will centre on the **Evo SL**, its design ethos, and its place in Adidas\u2019 lineup. (*Yes, you can ask about other models - but no promises.*)  \n\n**Global timings:**  \n- **CET (Central Europe):** 5:00-6:00 PM  \n- **BST (UK):** 4:00-5:00 PM  \n- **CT (US Central):** 10:00-11:00 AM  \n- **ET (US Eastern):** 11:00 AM-12:00 PM  \n- **PT (US West Coast):** 8:00-9:00 AM  \n- **AEST (Australia):** 1:00-2:00 AM (4th June)  \n\n**A polite reminder:**  \n- **Keep it constructive**. This is your chance to grill a global brand lead - not the time to rehash your 2018 Boost midsole grievances.  \n- **Respectful dialogue only**. Hate speech, personal attacks, or trolling will result in **permanent bans**. Let\u2019s keep it civilised.  \n- **Avoid speculative topics** like Trump-era tariffs. Simon\u2019s expertise is footwear design, not trade policy (*and frankly, even economists are confused*). \n\n**How to prep:**  \n1. **Upvote** so even the pre-dawn runners in AEST don\u2019t miss out.  \n2. **Draft questions** about the Evo SL - Adidas will create a new separate post for the AMA - but you can brainstorm some questions in this post.  \n3. **Tag your shoe geek friends** - the more people we can reach, the better!.  \n \n**P.S.** We have confirmation for an AMA in July with another current hot brand. Stay tuned once we confirm the details!\n\nMod Team  ",

      "Cool series.\n\nQuestions I'd have about the evo sl:\n\nDo they plan to make a v2\n\nIf not, will they do an update to the shoe in any form?\n\nWhy do they not change the laces they use, they seem universally quite poor.\n\nWhat was the rationale behind the short tongue and slippery insole? I can semi understand it as a lifestyle option but why use race foam in a lifestyle shoe.",
      "Can someone ask about getting better shoelaces! I love the Adizero line up but I always have to buy new laces. I just want laces long enough to do a runners knot and just a bit thicker.",
      "I\u2019ve been wondering about the sort of medial cut out. Is it there to match the Evo 1 design or is it for some other purpose. \n\nI swapped out the laces for ribbed laces which improves the shoe a fair bit so my only gripe is the tongue that slides to the side or sometimes slides in.",
      "I'd be interested to know if adidas have any intention of going down the route of a more crowd friendly supershoe in the face of marathons and halfs becoming increasingly popular.  There are few carbon plated options that offer much or any stability.  ASICS have gone down this route with the S4 Yogiri but admittedly I don't know a great deal about that shoe.",
      "Internally, How do Adidas see the usage split between the Boston 13 and Evo SL?  \nReviewers seem split on use case for the Boston 13 as the SL is such a well received shoe.\n\nSecondly; Why do Adidas persevere with the hideous laces?\n\nThirdly; More a statement. Put the AP4 upper on the AP3 lower and market it for us big guys. You'll never have to make another Super Shoe."

    "title": "Topo Mtn Racer 4 First Run Impressions",
    "selftext": "Took these out over the weekend for a 9 mile/1100 ft trail run here in Colorado. Typical CO hiking trails consisting mostly of dirt and rocks with the occasional root and sand section.\n\nFit: This is my first topo and people are not lying about the shape of these. Shaped like a piece of pie. Narrow in the heel and rear midfoot and then just a voluminous palatial toe box. Reading the changes they made to the 4, it sounds like there was some heel slop in the 3 and that's certainly been fixed here. If anything, my heel feels like it could be hanging off the edge of the insole but it leads to a fit where my foot is locked in and never moved even with the wide toe box. Upper feels built out and solid and gave plenty of protection on toe strikes.\n\nMidsole: It's a 5mm drop shoe but oddly feels like a high drop shoe when just standing around on flat ground (similar feeling I had with the Triumph 20). This feeling goes away during the run. The midsole is fairly firm but responsive. Essentially what I'm looking for in a trail runner. No instability and the ground feel is better than something with a rock plate but not going to give you the princess and the pea either. It's a 33mm/28mm stack and that's essentially how this feels underfoot.\n\nOutsole: Apparently this is the tried and true Vibram megagrip outsole topo loves to use. No complaints and this is probably a \"if it aint broke\" situation. Grip felt great springing off rocks, kept grip in sandy sections, and the big lugs were able to keep everything locked down on fast downhill sprint sections.\n\nMisc Thoughts: This is not a light shoe. Weighed in right around 313g for a US 10 on my scale so I doubt it's going to be something racers would be reaching for. It's a shoe that feels like it's built for cruising longer distances and that's how I plan to use it. Their FKT TPU insole is interesting. With thin socks, you definitely feel the textured tpu beads underfoot. Legs and feet felt great after the run with no hotspots developing anywhere.",

      "I really liked the 3 for the most part, other than the upper holding a ton of water. It was also surprisingly not very protective. Used it for first 50 of a 100 miler and my feet have never hurt so much at the end of race. I just don't think Topo's foam with any plate is enough protection for me without more stack. I'm tempted by the Vista but the Prodigio Ultra is similar stats and lighter.",
      "I've noticed the new insoles take up more space and curved upward in a way that might bother wide or flat feet. The shoe felt better after putting in the older racer 3 insole. Aside from the insole, everything else is a small upgrade for me.",
      "Not a fan of the swallow tail heel design, but definitely excited to hear that it\u2019s fairly similar to previous models. MTN Racers have kept my feet in incredible condition for every ultra I\u2019ve done. I just wish they\u2019d use TPU for the *midsole* (like Triumph 20s) since, in my experience, it compresses way more gracefully than any other material. Cause my only complaint about Topos is that I can feel my footprint already smashed into the shoe after a long race with little expansion afterward."

Ran mostly on roads with a small amount of dirt trail.\n\n**Weather ran in:**\n\nDry and rainy conditions\n\n**My profile:**\n\nHeight: 6\u20190\u201d\n\nWeight: 160lbs\n\nWeekly mileage: 70 miles (\\~112km). 1:23 HM and 2:55 FM\n\nStrike Type: Shufflle-y, higher cadence midfoot striker\n\n**Overview:**\n\nI initially bought these to preserve my Alphafly 3's racing lifespan, but after setting my 5k, 10k and marathon PB in the DNE3, they have become my go-to shoe for harder workouts. And for the marathon in which I used them earlier this month, they made the run feel effortless, almost like I was on cruise control. \n\nOut of the box, the outsole was very tacky and great on a longer wet weather run. After 135 miles, the outsole in the midfoot area is starting to wear down and lose some of its grip, but the midsole still has plenty of life in it, so I'm planning to use them for one more marathon next month before relegating them exclusively to workouts.\n\n**Positives:**\n\n* Fits true to size\n* Easy to get a secure lockdown\n* Comfortable upper\n* Responsive midsole similar to the lightstrike pro foam in the Adios Pro 3\n* Stable platform even when taking sharp turns\n* Good wet weather grip\n\n**Negatives:**\n\n* They have stained multiple pairs of socks with purple blotches\n* They put more stress on my calves compared to other plated shoes I've used (e.g., adizero shoes)\n\n**Worth buying?:**\n\nYes.

    "title": "ASICS Novablast 5 after 500 km",
    "selftext": "Demographic info about me: 28 M, 5\u20198\u201d height, 60kg runner with an average of 45-50 km/week. 5k PB 25 min 14 sec, 10k PB 51 min 11 sec. Size UK male 8 (42.5), fit: true to size. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOn to the shoes now. (TL;DR at the end)\n\n\u00a0\n\n1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These are my first pair of proper running shoes. Though I\u2019ve been running for almost 3 years now, the first 2 (and a bit) were mostly when I wasn\u2019t really interested in running and just used to do about 2-3 km/day on the treadmill after my strength training in the gym. It was only since last November that I really fell in love with distance running and got serious about training in January. Purchased these shoes in February and there\u2019s been no looking back since.\n\n\u00a0\n\n2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now since I don\u2019t have any experience with any other proper running shoes being used long term, I\u2019m unsure of how valid my opinion about their wear and tear is, but other than the signs of being my daily running work horse, I don\u2019t think the shoes are showing any problems or major signs of breakdown (but I\u2019ve attached images, so you be the judge of that. Also p.s my shoes don\u2019t always look this clean. I wash them after every 100k of use and this is the image after washing and drying)\n\n\u00a0\n\n3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first thing I felt when I switched over to these from the shoes I was using previously (Skechers Pulse 2.0) was how PROPULSIVE, yet soft they felt. It was as if I wasn\u2019t having to put so much effort in moving forward and my runs became so bloody enjoyable that I couldn\u2019t get enough of them. I was finally able to understand what people meant when they talked about the \u2018pop\u2019 that came with this shoe.\n\n\u00a0\n\n4)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The midsole is incredibly soft and super comfy to run in. I usually do my long runs on weekends and the distance is usually 12-16 km. I have never once felt that these shoes were becoming tough to run in or harder or needing more from me even towards the last few km. The longest distance I\u2019ve done in these is a half marathon (my one and only till now) and even at the 20^(th)\u00a0kilometer these shoes felt supportive and good for more distance (please don\u2019t ask the time for the HM as this was just something I did on a random Sunday morning, by myself, as a proof of concept to myself that I can run more than the mental barrier of my own long run distance).\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After having used these shoes for about 200-250 km I started seeing a lot of posts about how they lose their \u2018pop\u2019 after 300-400 km if you don\u2019t give them time to rest/don\u2019t let the foam decompress between runs. This worried me quite a bit \u2018cause this is the only pair I have and even to get these I had to save up, so there was no way I could\u2019ve bought another pair when these went dead or another pair to make a \u2018rotation\u2019 so that these last longer.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n6)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, even at > 500 km, these don\u2019t seem to have lost their \u2018pop\u2019. They don\u2019t feel flat to me. I can\u2019t really tell any difference in them when I run today vs when I started running in them about 3 months ago. To me they still feel supportive, still feel propulsive and as forgiving on a Saturday (after 5 days of use) as they are on a Monday (after a 48 hour rest, as I try to take Sunday as a rest day. Also I think its pertinent to mention here that there is always a 24 hour interval between my runs as I run only every morning)\n\n\u00a0\n\n7)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So either I\u2019m not running enough distance in them for them to bottom out, or maybe I\u2019m kind of lighter than others who\u2019ve had this issue (?) But either way they still feel good.\n\n\u00a0\n\n8)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m in the Indian subcontinent and temperatures are insanely hot (think 25-30 degrees C even at 6 AM) but these shoes are very breathable and my feet don\u2019t feel uncomfortable even at these temps. Can\u2019t comment on wet grip though, coz I\u2019ve only run in these twice when it was raining and personally I had zero issues, but then again, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s anywhere close the amount of running I\u2019d need to do on a wet surface before commenting on their grip on rainy days\n\n\u00a0\n\n9)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can someone who\u2019s more experienced than me, kindly have a look at the wear on the outsole tread and suggest if I\u2019m a midsole/forefoot striker (because from the wear on the tread that I can see, it would seem to suggest that way right ?)\n\n\u00a0\n\nTL;DR: Unpopular opinion (maybe ?), but they don\u2019t seem to wear out as quickly/don\u2019t seem to lose their \u2018pop\u2019, as a lot of posts would have you believe (at least if you let them rest for 24 hours or so between runs). They\u2019re soft, comfy and incredibly fun to run in. Breathable and light, they make a really good work horse of a daily run shoe\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pnupqayh6i1f1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2631bd0d53aa2817b7452cd40eb39bced23f3071\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/btypobyh6i1f1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f66c7541e13f6672c9251a4181c6c13ed0ef9ec1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vfov2dyh6i1f1.jpg?width=4025&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb3d266704afc7efc336560cf2aa71ea9a208f23\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/scymsayh6i1f1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e149d81507ebd5a83658267c1cdd6fa5da63516f\n\n",

      "Most of the complaints that you adres you don\u2019t feel come from heavier (85kg+) runners. Maybe this is one of those typical shoes that work great for lighter and average runners but not so much for the bigger guys. It got great reviews on the typical review sites too. Obviously it\u2019s a great shoe.",
      "It probably helps that you are 60kg so the shoes aren't subjected to as much loading.",
      "Nice review. At some point, when my Nimbus give up, I wil be looking for shoes with more bounce and grip. Novablast and Superblast seem like solid options",
      "I am 81kg (not sure if that is heavy or not) and the noticeable bounce in the beginning is certainly lost for me after like 300-350km. However the shoe is still very soft under foot and protects the legs quite well. Even now at 500km I use them for longer runs (up to 25km) at easy pace (for me 5'30 min/km) and they feel very well. For me the NB5 was a big upgrade from the NB4, which I did not like at all."

    "title": "Mizuno Neo Zen & Adidas EVO SL - My Thoughts",
    "selftext": "\nHi guys, \n\nI\u2019ve been running in the Adidas EVO SL since February and have covered over 600km in 2 pairs, so feel like I know the shoe inside out. \n\nConversely I ran for the first time in the Mizuno Neo Zen today and have some initial thoughts for those who were thinking about trying either. \n\nAbout me: male, average at best runner, heavy at 100kg and 6ft 2. Zone 2 around 6:00/km. High volume foot, usually 10.5UK in everything. I prefer lighter daily shoes and don\u2019t like the clunky thick uppers on max cushion shoes. \n\nThe reason for trying these was that I\u2019d had 2 pairs of the Evo SL and wanted to try something that wa similar. I initially bought a pair of Rebel v4, but didn\u2019t like the upper. I couldn\u2019t get a discount on the Evo SL anymore and the Neo Zen were on offer. \n\nComparisons: I\u2019ve read online about the shoes being similar and I don\u2019t really agree. The foams are similar where they appear to \u2018switch on\u2019 when pushed, but that is about it. \n\nUpper\n\nEVO SL:\n- Great fit for me personally\n- No issues with tongue, lacing, or lockdown\n- Good width in the toe box but not overly long\n\nNeo Zen:\n- Sizing was tricky\u2014I initially dropped half a size, then another, and finally settled on UK 10\n-Slightly long for my foot but still felt secure\n- Lockdown isn\u2019t as strong as the EVO SL, but somehow still feels stable at all paces\n- It\u2019s a unique, almost floaty feeling, but comfortable. \n\nMidsole & Ride\n\nNeo Zen:\n- Noticeably softer underfoot\n- Minimal rocker; felt like I had to actively think about engaging my forefoot to keep the stride efficient\n- Protective and forgiving, especially on easy runs\n\nEVO SL:\n- Firmer and more aggressive\n- Much better rocker and roll-through feel\n- Didn\u2019t need to think about foot strike\u2014it just flows naturally\n- More suited to picking up the pace\n\n\nOther Observations\n- Neo Zen feels more stable overall, especially at slower speeds where the EVO SL can feel a bit twitchy.\n- Cornering is where the Neo Zen really shines\u2014it handles tight turns with confidence.\n- I realise they\u2019re different shoes, but the Neo Zen reminds me of the Nimbus 25. However, it fits better, is softer, more responsive and lighter fit in general. \n\nIf I had to categorize:\n- Neo Zen = Daily miles, with light tempo capability\n- EVO SL = Better for faster efforts and structured workouts, but a bit much for daily use\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI\u2019m really glad I gave the Neo Zen a go. It\u2019s incredibly soft yet still responsive, which is a rare combo. I honestly didn\u2019t think I\u2019d find a shoe I liked as much as the EVO SL, but the Neo Zen is a fantastic alternative for different kinds of runs.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a daily trainer that\u2019s comfortable, fun, and easy to run in, I\u2019d say the Neo Zen is probably the better all-around option.",

      "Completely agree, though similar in pep and softness they are different, I always say the Evo SL is a tempo show that can handle slow paces and the Neo Zen is a daily shoe that doesn\u2019t mind picking up the pace. \n\nI understand your comparison to the Nimbus but the big difference being if you try to push in the Nimbus it feels like it\u2019s absorbing your energy instead of bouncing back like the Neo Zen.",
      "Have tried both on, but have only purchased the Neo Zen. \n\nThey really are just about the perfect daily trainer and long run shoe. Bouncy, comfortable, versatile, and I absolutely love the upper - secure, but with enough stretch to avoid any sort of pinching or tightness, even as feet swell over long miles. Just a great shoe all around",
      "Thanks for your thoughts. I plan on getting similar: the Evos for tempos and though I REALLY wanna try the Zens, I think I'm going for the Vistas, for long runs. I tried the latter in-store and they felt really good, pretty bouncy. Maybe the Zens down the line for recovery.\n\nWith Adidas I'm between UK 8 and 8.5, and like a snug fit. You think 8 would be good or too short?",

Current running shoe is the Novablast 4 so im excited to see how these compare",
      "Grabbed a couple pairs at the REI member sale. Ghost 17 as my daily driver and the Endorphin Speed 4 for faster workouts. The third pair are the Launch 11. I also use those for speed/tempo workout. I didn\u2019t NEED the Endorphin 4s, but I ended up getting then for \\~120 and I really wanted to try them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/735elfaeoe1f1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93d9429e36130bed5ead2a56cfb555562ff3bb31",

Got these for $70 off sierra.com. They already feel so good and different in a good way. I\u2019ve always loved Merrell but my last couple of pairs have worn really quick and I just run about 10 miles per week. Hoping for an altra experience (hehe pun)!"

    "title": "ASICS Novablast 5, 473 miles (761 km) Review",
    "selftext": "I know there are plenty of NB5 reviews but thought I\u2019d share a higher mileage review.\n\n**Total distance ran:**\n473 miles (761 km), planned to take it to 500 (still might), but my Neo Zens arrive today. \n\n**Type of runs:**\nMostly easy pace runs at 5 or 10 miles on roads, trails, or crushed limetestone.  A few threshold workouts on asphalt\n\n**Weather ran in:**\nWisconsin winter & spring so snow, a few sub zero F (-18 C) runs, freezing rain, rain, sunny, dry etc\n\n**My profile:**\nWashed up older running trying to get in race shape again & have fun.  Most recent race was an 8k in 28:58.\nHeight: 5\u20198\u201d (173 cm)\nWeight: 135 lbs (61 kg)\nAge: 45\nRange of average pace with this shoe: Easy, long runs @ 8:20 min/mile ( 5:10 min/km), sub threshold work @ 6:15 (3:52 min/k)\nStrike Type: midfootish?, 170 cadence\nAverage mileage: 50 miles (80 km) a week shared between NB5 & EVO lately.  Use NB5 for 3-4 of those runs between 20- 25 miles a week.\n\n**Positives:**\n* Durability - see overview\n* Good for hills - foot pod bounces you up them\n* Comfort - Every shoe has given me issues except this shoe. It\u2019s a lace it & forget it shoe. I\u2019ve never had to stop mid run to adjust laces.  I don\u2019t even have to tie the laces snug to get a good lockdown.\n* Grip - Didn\u2019t stand out as bad or great at first. Grip becomes really good though around 200 miles. I didn\u2019t trust AP3 grip so used these for a few spring speed workouts.  NB5 hugged asphalt path well when running through snow/ice melt on corners. \n* Very fun, energetic, protective, lightweight, & stable.\n\n**Negatives:**\n* Runs long - I bought it in my usual size 9 but in wide since I have slightly wide feet.  I feel I could have went with 8.5 in wide or 9 in regular. I can never get sizing right with Asics shoes.\n* Is too soft for speed sessions for 1 shoe owners, but is likely OK for tempo runs\n\n**Overview:**\nNew polyolefin elastomer foam in this shoe is excellent. It claims to improve bounce & keep shoe soft/bouncy in cold weather & it does this very well. My Nimbus & AP3 turned into bricks when running in below 15F (-9C) weather, but NB5 stayed soft & bouncy. \n\n*Durability:*\nAround 300 miles I noticed the foot pod trampoline effect was dulled, but rest of shoe was still responsive, soft, & bouncy. At 400 miles the front of shoe lost bounce, but back of shoe still had plenty of bounce. Reminds me of a biofeedback device that notifies me when I heel strike because it bounced me forward if I heelstriked. Even with some bounce being gone the shoe is still very protective, so no reason to stop using it in the 400s or before for me.  Heel bounce finally died at 466 miles. \n\nThis is a 500 mile shoe. I wore it 7 days a week for the 1st 30 days for the month of Dec. Then alternated it with Nimbus 26 for months of Jan-March. Then I mixed in AP3 a little, & now alternate it with EVO SL that I use for threshold days 3 days a week. NB5 is easily my favorite of the bunch.   Upper is still in excellent shape.\n\n**Worth buying?:**\nYes. Maybe my all time favorite shoe since it\u2019s light, yet protective, bouncy, fun & very comfortable with good grip. This is the only shoe I\u2019ve worn that makes easy & long runs on dead legs actually fun.\nGreat value shoe that also makes a great winter shoe. I may buy these again on discount next winter depending on how NB6 is. \n\n\n\n.\n",

      "Hurricane 24: I\u2019ve got a love/hate relationship with this shoe. On the one hand its foam feels fantastic, which is great for easy or lung runs, which is what I bought it for. The wide, stable base is great when I\u2019m not trying to push pace. \n\nOn the other, I cannot seem to get a good heel lock, and with the upper being low volume any attempt to do so causes lace bite. It\u2019s also soooo heavy and I\u2019m finding my legs are sore after wearing them.\n\nAnyone else have a similar experience with this shoe?",
      "Tried the Saucony Tempus 2 this week. I normally run in Kayanos, but wanting to find a shoe that can pick the pace up for tempo and intervals (while still having good cushion for a 10+ mile day)\n\nIt was the best fitting shoe I have ever put on my feet! I was so in love and thought I had finally found the perfect shoe.\n\nBut, I got intense pain in my left medial arch about 6.5 miles into my run. Very sad.",
      "Running with the Saucony Endorphin Speed 4. I found them great for sprints and fast interval sessions. They're really comfortable and have a nice roll. The only downside for me is that after running 250 km, the toebox started to wear out.",
      "Went to Sports Basement today and spent about an hour trying on shoes. I was originally interested in the ES4 when they first came out awhile back, but the lack of 2E options killed it for me as I have wide feet, so I never looked into them. Normally I wear a size 7 2E. I noticed that they had a size 8 D (regular width) in stock so I tried them on and holy moly, they *almost* fit like a glove. The width felt fine (not great, but not too tight) which is to be expected being a full size up but what surprised me was that the length wasn't too much longer than my regular fit either. I was expecting to be swimming in them, but I wasn't.\n\nI am now seriously on the fence about buying a pair (especially since they're on sale currently) and thinking about going .5 size up instead of a full size to dial in the length a bit, just hopeful that the width will still be OK. The upper is extremely comfortable and stretchy which I think will help. \n\nSaucony sizing has always been so weird for me. My Triumph 20s are 7 2E and they fit me like a glove. My Kinvara 14s are 7 2E and those are so tight that I don't even touch them anymore; I actually had to double check the tag after trying them on for the first time because they were so narrow.",

I am a true 10.5 4E but my usual running shoes are 11, with laces adjusted for a roomy fit. My SF2 are 11. With laces adjusted they fit comfortably snug, but a 5K race done previously left me with a blister on the right ball of foot. Stick to the 11 or perhaps try an 11.5?",

    "title": "Mizuno Neo Vista 2 100km Review - A Mixed Bag",
    "selftext": "Full disclaimer: I was given these shoes free of charge as part of Mizuno's seeding programme through my local running store where I work some casual hours. I don't have to like them, I don't have to provide them any feedback and I can do as a I please with them. \n\nI love the original Neo Vista. It is my go to long run shoe and soaks up long kilometres like they barely exist. The fit is great, the upper is snug and fits like a glove, the midsole is soft and buttery smooth and the rocker just makes it all work together in harmony. But, it is my long run shoe and my long run shoe only. At anything south of 5:00min/km pace, they feel really clunky and too mushy. Also, being so soft, they become fairly unstable when fatigued or trying to turn corners. The Vista 2 looks very similar in appearance to the original Vista but there are changes to just about every part of the shoe, some for better, some for worse in my opinion. The Vista 2 comes in at 265g for a US9 with a stack height of 44.5/36.5mm for a drop of 8mm (all the same as the original Neo Vista). \n\nBackground: 30yo, 65kg, midfoot strike, usually race over ultra distance, 5k 17:31, 10k 35:56. \n\nThe look: The Vista 2 are definitely less other-worldly looking than the original Vista. They still have the large platform and the knit upper which I really like the look of. I wasn't too keen on the new shark fin type design but it's grown on me I must admit. I'm interested to see what other colors release later on. I have been told that the Vista 2 will have more colour way drops than the previous now that the model line looks to be here to stay for the foreseeable future (I've been lucky enough to have put 20km into a pair of pre-production Vista 3s so there's at least another couple of years of them). \n\nThe upper/fit: Personally, it isn't my favourite upper in the world. It is very similar to the Neo Zen for those who have used that shoe. It doesn't have the same snug feeling of the original that I really liked. There is a lot of extra baggage around the toe box and I get a fair bit of scrunching of the knit material around the laces when laced up. I can see why they have done this though since whilst I loved the original upper, many found it too narrow/tight and not at all breathable. Both of those issues would be fixed by this change in the Vista 2. The shark fin on the outside of the shoes is also a fairly solid piece of overlay which definitely gives some structure and stability to the heel area. In terms of sizing, I went true to size and they are probably a smidge too big but definitely runnable. It turns out though that the seeding pairs given out have been running a half size too big across the board which would explain them being a bit big. I have been told that this issue has been fixed in the production models that will be sold on the shelves next month though so true to size should be the way to go.\n\nThe midsole: This for me is where the most exciting change has been. The midsole is now a dual layer setup with the foam from the previous Vista on the bottom and the same foam from the Neo Zen on top. For anyone who hasn't run in the Neo Zen, it's a ridiculously bouncy shoe. The new midsole setup makes the shoe more fun to run in and definitely more versatile. I've run down to the low 4min/ks and this shoe can handle it okay. Don't get me wrong, it's still not a shoe I would ever pick up for a tempo run or a speed session, but it is far more than a shoe that just does slow long runs now I think, more along the lines of a Superblast than the first Vista. Not being quite as soft has helped with the stability of the midsole as well but still with it's stack height and soft feel, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who needs a stable ride. The fibreglass plate does fibreglass plate things and the rocker is just as good as it was in the first version. \n\nThe outsole: no big changes here. There has been a change to the shape of the outsole which has a bit more surface area than the original Vista possible helping a little with stability. The only other change is the tread pattern is now a beefier, checkered pattern rather than the wavy pattern on the original. There's nothing special traction wise, it sticks where most shoes do and slips where most shoes do. It's the same rubber underneath so I expect the wear to be the same as the original Vista which have been really good on that front for me. \n\nConclusion: the Vista 2 comes with a baggier, more breathable upper and a more lively, more stable midsole which makes it a more versatile shoe still suited towards eating up big kilometres without much thought but able to handle the odd marathon pace repeat if necessary.",

      "Thanks for the review!\n\nI thought the Neo Zen and the original Neo Vista shared the same foam formula. What\u2019s the difference between them?",
      "Super helpful review/comparison, thanks for doing this! The original Vista is my favorite shoe ever, so I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t do anything to really upset the formula too much.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m on my second pair and also use them exclusively for long, chill-to-HM-pace miles and I honestly wouldn\u2019t change a single thing about the first generation for that use case. I feel like I have better shoes for shorter runs and much better shoes for faster ones, so the first-gen NV just slots so beautifully into my lineup as my \u201clong run day\u201d shoe.\n\nSo maybe I\u2019ll just buy a third pair of the first gen when they are discounted for second gen.",
      "Excellent review thanks.  I'm a big fan of my pair of Neo Zens and if they added that marshmallow TPU to the Vista midsole I'm sure it'll be a fun and bouncey ride.",
      "I too loved the glove-like fit of the Mizuno vista 1. The effect of the fit in function is underrated. Most running shoes imo should be comfortably snug with a relatively stretchy upper. I hope sizing down in v2 will fix the issue. I hate baggy running shoes."

Looks like by trying to make the H3 a more broadly appealing shoe, they are losing sight of its core constituency.  Classic positioning mistake.\n\nHaving said that, I'll keep an open mind until I try a pair myself.  Surprised that there are no previews available on line from testers, as their are for the Hyperion Max 3 which is going to be released on the same day.",

    "selftext": "For context: I am 186cm and 65kg, size 10US, I do ~35-40k a week. I wanted a second pair to my all rounder Nike Pegasus 41 which I do like for its simplicity.\n\nThe idea was a tempo shoe without full carbon plate and not too soft. So the new boston was my choice.\n\nI have completed a 10k tempo run (~4:30/km) and am very satisfied.\n\nFit: \nTrue to size. 100% of my shoes are 10US and this fit me well.\nI do not have the widest foot, but still not very narrow. The toebox felt really nice! Some space width-wise is a win for me. The front was also pleasantly shaped, not crunching my toes inside. It is a snug, but not too tight fit overall. The back heel socket feels steady, but not too firm. The tongue is soft. There is a lack of arch support but I was ready for it.\n\nMaterial etc: The shoe is very light compared to what I tried. The material is breathable, which made it a good european summer choice. The stack is pretty high (36mm) but not a platform hight. The foam is of 2 parts - a softer and a sturdier one. The heel felt very soft, but as I mid foot striker I do not care that much, just a note. The front felt more controlled.\n\nFor me a huge advantage is, that the midfoot/front of the sole is a bit wider, which provides more stability. I enjoyed that, I feel like it would prevent some injuries later.\n\nThe run: The shoe felt right on point for a tempo run. Snappy, a bit aggressive in terms of a forward rocker, so sending you forward. The lacing gave enough support and lock - my foot did not move to the front of the shoe overtime. I felt faster than usual so I guess it was a good thing.\n\nThe fiber glass inserts make it more snappy. I have never tried carbon, so I can't provide a comparison - sorry. But as far as I heard it is a bit less stiff than carbon - correct me if I'm wrong. The general feeling of fiber glass is nice.\n\nPros: I do like the design and the colorway! For me it looks fun and a bit futuristic. The snug and comfy fit with a bit wider toebox is a win. The snappy run feeling is something new for me and I liked it. The rocker shape (rising toe) is also a speed advantage.\n\nCons: The laces are a bit cheap to the touch - I feel like they will not last too long. But there is a second blue pair - the same color as the stripes. Anyway, they are also short. There is no way to use the last hole for a heel lock - they are barely enough for a normal knot. Have not found any other cons yet tbh.\n\nSo I think I can recommend them as a tempo shoe! Nice new model. Hope they last me and I will still like them.\n\nThanks for reading, please ask anything that you might want to know or correct me if I am wrong anywhere. Cheers!",

    "selftext": "# Total distance ran:\n\n442 miles (712 km)\n\n# Type of runs:\n\nOriginally easy and longish runs up to 10 miles (16km)\n\nQuickly left them for shorter easy runs up to 6 miles (10km)\n\nAlways run in pavement/paved parks. \n\n# Weather ran in:\n\nUK weather. From rainy weather and very cold to sunny mid 20's (celsius)\n\n# My profile:\n\nHeight: 5'10'' (179cm )\n\nWeight: 160 lbs (73kg)\n\nRange of average pace with this shoe: \n\n* Mainly used them at paces between 8:50-10:30 min/mile (5:30-6:30 min/km).\n* Sometimes pushed the pace for some tempo around 7:30min/mile (4:30 min/km)\n\nStrike Type: Mid-forefoot striker. Run with these particular shoes at around 170spm cadence.\n\nAverage runs a week: 6 runs per week up to 40 miles (65km).\n\n# Positives:\n\n* Light and fast for a daily.\n* Encourages high turnover.\n* With fresh foam, they're fun and propulsive.\n* The outsole and upper seem to last forever.\n\n# Negatives:\n\n* Stock laces are trash.\n* The sizing on these shoes has been a particular nightmare for me.\n* I get blisters with them. Something about the insole doesn't sit right with me.\n* They're not adequate for longish runs. They bottom and become a pain to run with after 10-12kms.\n* The midsole deteriorates unevenly (due to the 2 different foam layers across the whole midsole?) and caused lots of annoyances and niggles.\n* Foam durability is on the low side. I would expect better from a daily trainer.\n* When foam deteriorates, causes intermittent pain during the runs (feels like landing on a pebble under a particular point under your football). \n\n# Overview:\n\nBought these shoes at full price as soon as they got launched to replace my beloved Kinvata 14s that I've been using as a \"do it all\" shoe.\n\nMy original big issue with these shoes was **the fit.**\n\nMy usual size (UK 8) felt a bit too snug, so ended up going for a half size up and this turned out to be a big mistake. The half-size-up felt perfectly comfortable until I started running with them. \n\nThe feet moved within the shoe, blisters started happening... and was too late to return them! \n\nThe only solution was to tighten them massively, but the stock laces were so bad that it was uncomfortable, getting lace bites, etc. So, as you can see in the pictures, lock laces were the only way I managed to get tight and even fit with these shoes. That and thick socks.\n\nOn my second pair I went for my TTS size (UK 8) and, while felt a little bit \"compressive\" they work much better for me (still replaced the laces for sawtooth Alphafly style ones). As the shoe relaxes the TTS worked much better for me regarding sizing.\n\n  \n**Running with them** \n\nMy first impression (that I'm experiencing again since I've just started running in my fresh second pair of SL2) is \"These shoes are fun and bouncy!\". \n\nThey're light, they are bouncy but not too bouncy, they're not too rigid or clunky, they're fun!\n\nI would say that for a daily trainer, is a shoe that leans more towards short and easy km that can pick up the pace rather than easy km that can run for many km with them (like my Puma Magnify 2, to compare).\n\nIs a daily that responds very well to pace changes, doing some tempos... Yesterday I was running with my fresh pair and ended up pushing the pace from 9:17min/mile (5:45min/km) easy run to 7:40min/mile (4:45min/km) for 2kms. The shoe is not as good as the Adidas Evo SL for this purpose, but it is capable.\n\nOne of the problems I've found with these shoes is that I first had some blisters when I was reaching 6 miles (10km) running with them. Some rubbing and heat are feeling on my football, and then a blister or skin peeling off shows up when I remove them after the run.\n\nThen after achieving a better fitting and having no more blisters, I started getting niggles and foot pain when reaching 7.5 miles (12km) or so. The midsole seemed to bottom out and each step turned into a pain.\n\nSo I started reducing the distances I would reach these shoes for, and I ended up getting a more maximalist shoe for longer slow runs: The Puma Magnify 2. That does the job with absolutely 0 niggles of annoyance.\n\nAfter a while, even the shorter runs started feeling \"harsh\" on the feet. I would feel the landing on the football under the big toe like hitting a pebble. This feeling would come and go. But each time was showing up sooner during my runs. I was about to retire them at 285 miles (460km), which was crazy for me as my first serious shoes, the Kinvara 14, didn't feel anything near that for the 500 miles (800km) I used them. \n\nBut then, somehow, they felt \"uniform\" again. And these issues went away. The shoes looked so good on the outside that I felt bad retiring them, so I kept sticking to them for easy runs up to 6 miles (10km), and for quite a while they stopped bothering me.\n\nThat is how I reached 440 miles (700km) with them.\n\nI would say that when I reached a bit above 400 miles, I started noticing that the shoes completely lost any bounce... felt completely dead even on easy runs. \n\nTried my new fresh pair (bought on black Friday at 50%) and \"Oh I like these shoes! They're so bouncy and fun!\". \n\nThere we go again.\n\n# Worth buying?:\n\nI wouldn't buy them at full price again. \n\nI'm not a fan of the midsole durability and the niggles I had with them. And as I use them exclusively for easy runs I think there are much better shoes around (I am traveling to Japan soon so I may come back with some Mizunos).\n\nI would buy them again if heavily discounted and bin them as soon as the midsole goes down.

      "I've had the same blistering with this shoe. I went 0.5 size up, but I think this was necessary just for the general fit. I think I'd be having other issues if I went true to size. \n\nI originally wanted to wear them for all sorts of runs, but the blistering became such a problem, that I've now limited them to runs under 10km, and even then at around 7km I start feeling hot spots. \n\nI do really like the shoe, besides the blistering. It's light and responsive. The upper is good, and the outsole seems to have solid grip and durability. \n\nI don't have this issue with any other Adidas shoe, which is odd.",
      "I agree with everything you said about the turnover. Definitely promote quick turnover and can be peppy. However, I can\u2019t do more than 6-7 miles per run in them. I start to realize how little structure they have, imo, at that mileage. I used them as a tempo-ish daily. \n\nHowever, my first 5-6 runs in them I absolutely hated them. But they came around. They\u2019re quicker than the NB5 but not as good for repeated daily runs imo. I\u2019d say value wise with employee store discounts I get through work is pretty solid though. I hope the next model has a conti sole as well for durability and they need to do something about the insole which for me, is the worst part about the shoe. I\u2019d also note that they give me Achilles pain for the first mile or so",
      "I cant get past 550km on my pair. They feel dead and flat as a pancake and hurt my knees badly now even at slow pace. I really liked them for the first 200km then was a struggle. Definitely prefer the Boston 12 to the SL",
      "Retired mine at like 240km, i was confused with them from the first runs and even tho i gave them a lot of chances, they still didn't clicked, not to mention that the midsole started to unglue."

My wife and I both decided to get the NB4 after reading the review on RunRepeat, and trying them on in-store\u00a0[https://runrepeat.com/asics-novablast-4](https://runrepeat.com/asics-novablast-4)\u00a0. I have gone from 31 minute 5kms down to a pb of 23m50s, thanks in large part to the enjoyment from these very comfortable shoes.\n\nI went from New Balance 680v7 to the NB4, which instantly became my daily trainer.  I now rotate NB4, Puma Forever Run Nitro, Hoka MachX2, and the 680v7.  The NB4 is my preferred shoe for longer runs. They're good for recovery runs, zone 2, anything up to threshold pace, really. They are surprisingly springy the faster you go, but very cushioned for longer runs. I rotate them with Puma Forever Run Nitro as a recovery, zone 2 shoe, but the NB4 feels more cushioned than the Pumas. I put this down to the additional thickness in the mid-forefoot, compared to the Pumas.  I use Hoka MachX2 for faster runs and Parkrun, these are less stable but springy and fast.  The 680v7 are reserved for short hill sprints or speed work on grass, and I find I'm in pain unless I run with a VERY high cadence. \n\n**General observations**\n\n\\- The NB4 is a stable, comfortable, and cushioned ride. Given the height of the stack, stability is achieved through rigidity and width, but I haven't had issues with the shoes rubbing together or ankle striking.\n\n\\- I loved them new and continue to look forward to their spot in the rotation.\n\n\\- Out of the box, amazed at how much I sank into them with every step.\n\n\\- As a daily I was very happy with how they performed across different effort levels and speeds.\n\n\\- At 250km they are slightly less soft underfoot, and I notice less that sinking/spongy sensation experienced out of the box, however they still have heaps of bounce and impact absorption. I noticed this last night when I did some high knees to warm up and felt a lot of bounce and spring.\n\n\\- I still notice the bounce and sponginess at faster speeds, and overall I think the FFBlast+ midsole is holding up well.\n\n**Wear**\n\n\\- A few decals on the insole have rubbed away (photos 1 and 2), but otherwise the upper is durable.\n\n\\- I have noticed that the exposed midsole is wearing away (photos 3 and 4), however I'm not aware of any impact this is having on the shoe.\n\n\\- I supinate slightly, landing on the outer forefoot (when fresh), and by about 8-9kms, am landing pretty flat. The outsole seems hard wearing and I have plenty of outsole left to get through.\n\n**Construction/breathability**\n\n\\- They're nicely rigid, not overly stiff, but also not so flexible that your foot and metatarsals have to do all the work.\n\n\\- There isn't a huge amount of ventilation, and the fabric is a tight weave. Over summer, the hottest temperature I took them out was circa 34\u00b0C, once the sun had set. I definitely noticed my feet were hot, but to be fair at that point everything was hot. More recently on runs between 18 - 23\u00b0C, shoe temperature hasn't been an issue for me.\n\n\\- The laces are long, and slightly stretchy enabling reasonable lock down, without having to over tighten. Given the tongue is quite thin and I have a reasonably high arch, this has been great.\n\n\\- This is my first gusseted tongue shoe. Absolutely no tongue movement, and the upper has a really great feel to it. They are very comfortable on.\n\n\\- US 11 fit leaves me a good amount of room for toe movement, and I haven't noticed any blood flow restriction or numbness even on longer runs.\n\n\\- They feel light when on, which given the amount of cushion is great.\n\n**Traction**\n\nI have used them in dry conditions and haven't really had the chance to use them in the wet so cannot vouch for their grip. In the dry I haven't experienced any traction issues. I tend to run on pavement and asphalt, occasionally getting on to dirt tracks and grass.\n\n**Summary**\n\nGreat shoe, no complaints, hard wearing, comfortable. Will post a review when I get to 500kms, I assume they will get that far, if not further. I'm very happy with them and have no hesitation recommending these shoes as a daily, do it all trainer.",

      "I love my novablast 4s for about the first 20 minutes of my runs & then for some reason they just completely bottom out & i just sink into the foam. Ive won mine for about 130km & has been the same the whole time through every different thickness of sock & every lacing style there is. Really not sure what it is unfortunately but after about 20 minutes of running they just become unwearable for me, they have become a walking/ casual shoe for me now.",

      "Hi Russ!\n\nThanks for doing this -- I've been a big fan of Topo since first trying the cyclone 2 on Doctors of Running's reccomendation and instantly falling in love.\n\nMy question: What's being done to modernize/stylize upcoming Topo colorways? I've had multiple conversations with folks who would like to try Topo shoes but find the color ways to range from boring to ugly. I think the new Specter 2 and Atmos color ways were a step in the right direction but I'm wondering if you all have heard the same feedback. Thanks!",
      "I want to love your shoes so much as I really prefer shoes with an anatomical toe box and low/zero drop. I have tried various models of road and trail shoes in a few different sizes from Topo, but unfortunately they just never seem to work for me. The issue is usually the toe box feels great, but the midfoot is too narrow. Do you plan on making any different lasts/shapes that work for people with overall wider feet and low/flat arches?",
      "Do you think Topo will ever to make models without the aggressive arch support, or at least change the design to address this issue?",
      "Four questions:\n\n1. Are there any plans to release a carbon plated shoe in the future? I understand that would go against your philosophy of natural running movement, but I feel like that addition would help solidify your place in the market, especially for us wide footers seeking a race day shoe.\n2. Why is the mid foot designed to be so tight/snug? Feel like that's an issue for a majority of us. At least for me, everything else about the shoe is amazing except that midfoot.\n3. How will you improve on the Specter 2 for the future? Personally for me, I felt like the arch support was too much for me. It dug into my foot and caused swelling before the foam broke in and became a lot more comfortable. Also, the shoe could have used more snappiness (kind of what was in the Specter 1).\n4. How do you do width sizing in your models? It seems quite inconsistent across all models. Also I don't see a wide option for your performance trainers (Cyclone, Specter).\n\nI really appreciate how you have found your niche in offering shoes that are anatomical, especially for use wide footers that don't have many options. Thanks so much for taking the time to field our questions. I hope it results in better offerings for us hobby joggers!"

I purchased them while looking for an easy run shoe with \"max stack\" that came in wide, since I like room for my toes to spread out. Honestly, I initially hated on them. I didn't like the color, didn't like the huge chunk of foam, didn't even enjoy the ride. Over the last couple of months they have slowly become my daily trainer, and every run I swear they get better. I like them so much that I ran a half marathon in them and set a PR at 1:55 :\\^) Other shoes that I run in are the NB Rebel v4 and Topo Specter 2 -- both fit well and have room for my toes.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* Stable\n* Wide (purchased 11.5 wide which gives plenty of room in the toe box)\n* Soft (and getting softer each day)\n* Good lockdown\n* Very durable\n\nThe Just-Okay:\n\n* Only average breathability\n* Heavy\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* Slow -- but what do you expect :D they are huge!\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nThese are my first Hokas and first \"max stack\" shoes. I think they are great and will probably purchase another pair for when (if) these wear out. They are in great shape after 100 miles though so I figure they will last a while.",

    "title": "Puma Fast-R Elite 3 - First Run Impressions",
    "selftext": "Hi All\n\nI was lucky enough to snag a pair of Fast-R 3 on their release. I am slow runner and planned to use these for a marathon in August.  However I ended up with pneumonia and dropped out.\n\nI am still recovering from pneumonia and couldn\u2019t take them for a longer ride.\n\nDetails about me: slow runner and a mid/forefoot striker\n\nDistance: 2.5km\n\nShoe Model & Size: Puma Fast-R 3 Elite and US9 \n\nFit/Comfort: the fit is definitely race fit and comes in quite narrow. My feet are hanging off the sides lmao but it doesn\u2019t feel uncomfortable. Also some may find it that the shoe runs a tiny bit long but I do find the shoe fits true to size.\n\nReason for Buying: Marathon but dropped out due to illness \n\nPrice: $350AUD (Adidas Pro 4 $360, Alphafly 3  $380, Metaspeed Sky/Edge $360 [this is before the price drop due to the Metaspeed Tokyo releasing soon].\n\n*all prices are in $AUD\n\nThe price is unbelievably generous of Puma because the R-3 are the same price of the R-2 upon release. I know in the UK and USA R-3 prices are a-lot higher relatively. The price also makes this one of the more affordable race day shoes here in Aussie. I have a feeling Puma will increase the price lol.\n\n\nPuma Fast-R Nitro Elite 3 Review:\n\nUpper:\n\nthe Ultra weave upper is incredibly thin and transparent. Its a plasticky mesh weave similar to the ASICS Metaspeed series and its completely breathable. You will get your socks wet if you run in the rain lol.\n\nAlso the tongue is made with the same thin material and is not gusseted. The tongue does have loops for the laces to go through and this does keep the tongue in place.\n\nPuma gives you two laces which are white normal shoe laces and an aqua sharktooth laces. I swapped the white laces for the sharktooth laces, I mean it\u2019s a no brainer.\n\nMidsole:\n\nthe foam is probably the most interesting part of the shoe.\n\nI believe Puma has used different foams as per foot transition. I will try to explain this the best I can.\n\n*please see the last photo as a reference\n\nThe foam under heel is really firm and responsive.\n\nThen, the foam under the forefoot is airy, cushioning, soft and not as responsive.\n\nThen, the foam under the toes are firm and responsive again.  This creates an interesting ride which I will explain further down.\n\nThe firm foam feels similar to the Adidas Pro 3/Evo sl where theres a firmness and sharp bounce but without the density. The softer foam (under the forefoot) feels airy and soft and decompresses slower.\n\nOuter Sole:\n\nThe outer sole is the puma grip. Its a thin layer under the forefoot and its abit thicker on the heel.\n\nThe grip under the heel is nice and grippy while the outsole on the forefoot is alot less grippy and feels smoother. Overall the grip is nice and I don\u2019t feel like I would slip. This could change if it was raining.\n\nCarbon Plate:\n\nIts thin plate that has the middle cut out and goes all the way to the tip. The carbon plate is surprisingly stiff despite being so thin.\n\nThe Ride/First Run: \n\nIf I could describe the ride in a few words, it would be GO GO GO GO. It\u2019s incredibly aggressive but smooth. \n\nThe shoes just wants you to go fast and not stop. It honestly feels almost effortless hitting threshold pace (please in mind that I haven\u2019t trained for months due the pneumonia and I was hitting threshold pace like it was nothing). The shoes truly just disappears  underneath you.\n\nThe foam is energetic while being incredibly cushioning. You can feel the toe off from the plate and gives you a little pop too.\n\n\nPersonal Observations:\nNow I will explain how the different foams feel while running. As soon as you land you can feel the forefoot foam cushions you and makes a nice airy landing. At the same time the firmer heel foam immediately starts to respond and bounces back up. This creates a lift at the heel which encourages you in a forwarding motion of your foot, then next thing you know you are springing off your toes against the firmer bouncier foam. Not sure if other super shoes do this, I thought this was quite unique that Puma was using different foams for the foot transitions and not just doing different foams top and bottom like many other brands.\n\nAdditionally I found the geometry of the shoe does encourage a longer stride run pattern.\n\nYes, the shoe is quite unforgiving if you heel strike. It feels terrible and unstable. If you are a mid or forefoot striker, you will love this shoe. Also I feel like the shoe tends to pronate which feels a little weird as I am neutral runner. I am really impressed by Puma with the different foams used, the design, the weight cut, and the absolute smoothness. \n\nComparisons: \nI have used the Metaspeed Sky plus, Alphafly 3 and Adidas Pro 4. To be honest, the Fast-R 3 doesn\u2019t feel like any other super shoes I have used before. I have heard Fast-R 3 feel similar to the Metaspeed Sky Paris but unfortunately haven\u2019t had a chance to try them. \n\nOverall the shoe does live up to the hype. \n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions.",

      "I don't think they've used different foams?\n\nWhat you're probably feeling is the different thickness of foam between your foot and the plate.\n\nThe plate is closer to your heel and then curves down so you have more foam under your midfoot. It then curves back up towards your toes. \n\nIt feels unstable towards the heel due to the amount of foam under the plate.\n\nGood review though.",

The aggressive rocker helped propel me forward despite the large weight of the shoes and somewhat boring foam.\n\n**The Decline: From Recovery to Fatigue**  \nHowever, with each successive 25 miles\u2014until it reached 370 in its final run today\u2014it felt increasingly dull.\n\nThe foam, which at first felt bouncy, cushioned, and protective, degraded with each mile beyond 100 into a sandpit kind of sensation\u2014sucking away energy until I was left fatigued in my legs and working harder aerobically than during normal everyday running, despite going 30 seconds slower per mile. Rather than helping me recover or getting out of the way, the shoe began to feel clunky and desperate to absorb my energy rather than absorb and then propel.\n\n**The Blister Issue**  \nThis transformation of the foam was compounded by a frustrating, well-documented medial midfoot blister that consistently reared its head.\n\n**Final Verdict: A One-Trick Pony That Lost the Trick**  \nOverall, the shoe is a bit of a disappointment. A truly great experience for the first 100 miles, but beyond that, it felt like the act was up\u2014and I didn\u2019t like what remained at all. When a shoe is a one-trick pony, it needs to do the one trick well.",

      "Agree with your experience. Has now been relegated to a great standing / walking shoe",
      "This is what I wear to work. I love the shoe for walking but it responds like a brick when running",
      "I got 250km out of my more v4 with the same basic experience, a packed out midsole and finally pulling the pin after a particularly meaty blister.\u00a0\n\n\nBy comparison, I put 650km into my Nimbus 27, only throwing them out because I didn't have luggage space at the end of a trip - the midsole still had life but the outsole and upper were suffering. I have 300km on my Nimbus 25 and they are still great. My trabuco max are at 730 and doing fine.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm all in on thick slabs of FFBlast\u00a0",
      "I'm sort of there with my More V4, I loved them to begin.  recently I have started to really dislike them.  I have a good rotation and these are my very specific \"recovery\" mile only shoe.  So I had wondered whether I was naturally using them on days when I was very fatigued, i.e day after a race or hard session, therefore the struggle was irrelevant of the shoe's design, but even on fresh legs it just feels as dead as anything.  I'll continue using mine for a bit (they have about 350 miles) on but I never look forward to running in them despite them being supremely comfortable.  The shame is that I'm looking forward to retiring them, but they feel like they will last forever, the midsole feels dead, but then it was like that on day one !!"

    "selftext": "# About me\n\n39M close to 40. 179cm (5'10''), 73kg (160lb).\n\nSmall-ish feet for my height (UK8 261mm length and on the narrow side).\n\nMid-forefoot striker.\n\nCadence: around 170 in easy runs, around 185-195 during speed intervals.\n\nCasual runner who started running 17 months ago. I run for 5/10ks performance. I'm not very interested in longer distances. I do not race but train for fitness, health, and improving my times.\n\nCurrent 5k: 21:26. Current 10k: 45:03\n\nCurrent volume: Run 6 days per week. Getting to 60-65kms on an average week.\n\nI bought a stupid amount of shoes during this time. I enjoy getting top-spec models from a previous season for a bargain and being creative in explaining to my wife (who runs with a pair for Adizero SL for everything) why I needed new shoes.\n\n# About the shoes\n\nAdizero Adios 8 size 8 Uk (265JP).  \nI got the women's version for a bargain (60gbp) now that the Adios 9 is out. The width/fit in men/women is the same. So I confirm previous comments read here that they're unisex.\n\nAs you can see in the picture I replaced the stock laces, as the Adidas laces are terrible. I have found serrated-style laces to be the best for me as they \"lock\" very effectively and without any comfort issues.\n\n\\- The shoes combine Lightsrike Pro from mid to forefoot with Lightrike 2.0\n\n\\- 8 mm drop and around 20mm stack on the forefoot.\n\n\\- Some plastic shank on the midsole but doesn't look nearly as stiff as Adidas rods or a carbon plate.\n\n\\- They look very slick. This may be personal but they are beautiful.\n\n# What was I expecting from them?\n\nI do my workouts on paved parks, not on a track. My speed workouts include warm-up and cool-down kms done with the same shoes I do the speed intervals.\n\nI wanted a shoe that felt good enough on both the warming up at 5:30-6:00/km than doing a 200m interval at 3:45/km or less.\n\nOriginally had the Takumi Sen 8 for my speed workouts. But, while they bring a massive smile to me when running on the fastest range of my intervals, they're extremely uncomfortable on the feet due to their stiffness and narrow midfoot.\n\nAlso tried the Puma Deviate Nitro Elite for this purpose. And while they perform and are way comfier than the TS8, I have some intermittent calve issues when running with full carbon-plated shoes.\n\nThe EVO SL, while being amazing at tempo paces, is not snappy nor firm enough for short intervals. I've used them on a couple of sessions and they were \"okay\" for the job. But the shoe is too soft, it sinks too much for an effective acceleration and high cadence, and with the higher stack, it doesn't feel as safe when doing tight turns at full speed.\n\nSo the Adios line seemed to fit the bill: Fast for workout intervals, comfier than the Takumi, able to run at slower paces, non-carbon plated, and more flexible.\n\n# Fit\n\nFound them true to size. There is plenty of space and they are way wider than the Puma DNE or, especially, the TS8. But not nearly as loose/wide on the forefoot as the EVO SL.\n\nSo... nice fit! Given my narrowish feet. I lace them tight to avoid forefoot movement (prefer a snug fit for speed workouts) and the (almost always mandatory for me) runners knot to avoid any heel slippage.\n\nThe upper is \"plasticky\" and not padded at all. But is something that I'm very used to (TS8 and DNE) and never caused me any issues. The shoe fit feels magnitudes comfier than the TS8.\n\n# The first run\n\nWorkout on the short side (tapered week):\n\n\\- 2km warm-up at an easy pace (5:40-6:20 for me, I start the warm-ups slow and pick up the pace a bit after the first km).\n\n\\- 3 x 600m at 4:15/km with rests\n\n\\- 2 x 600m at 4:10/km with rests\n\n\\- 600m at 4:10km\n\n\\- 1.5km cool-down\n\nThe first thing I noticed is that these shoes have a very good grip. I was running in sunny conditions but definitely, the continental outsole feels to grab the road better than more modern shoes like the EVO SL or the Adizero SL2.\n\nLanding on the football on these shoes with their low stack feels firm, and you feel the ground. Reminds me of my old Saucony Kinvara 14 (the most \"do-it-all\" shoe I've ever run on) but with a firmer feeling. There is no \"bounce', just a firm return on each step.\n\nThe warm-up was comfortable with no dislikes. Felt like I could perfectly ditch my Adizero SL2 for easy short runs and use the Adios 8 instead. Unless you like a \"bouncy\" feeling, the shoes are not that uncomfortable nor stiff to make an easy pace on them miserable.\n\nThis reminds me why some reviewers (Sagatsu running if I recall right) love Adios 8 and Adios 9 for slow runs too.\n\nTime to pick up the pace. The first interval for 600m at 4:15. Easy turnover and high cadence achieved effortlessly, the firmness on the landing helps for this. I feel the ground but is not harsh at all. Oh, I am running faster than I thought and I'm at 3:55/km. Better to slow down a bit or I won't finish this.\n\nA few intervals down, what I notice is that the shoe is way more flexible than the TS8 or the Puma DNE. My feet flex a bit with each landing on the forefoot. No niggles, no pains, no sudden burning sensation in the middle of the plant that sometimes flares up with the DNE. My feet like it. My feet are happy.\n\nI miss a bit of the \"spring\" back from the TS8 when pushing the pace. With all their niggles and issues, the TS8 is the fastest shoe I have run on, and when you get a sub 4:00/min the rods work wonders for energy return.\n\nNot here, here you notice that the plastic shank does not do much, and the shoe flexes quite a bit with each step. Your foot is working, the energy return only comes from the foam, but there is no spring effect. So my feet are working more than when I run on the TS8 or DNE.\n\nThe Adios 8 feels way more forgiving on the landing than the TS8. You don't need to run in perfect form and align the landing in the right spot... they feel almost like trainers. Did I mention that they're comfy?\n\nTight corners at 4:00/km...not an issue on this shoe. Run the corner as tight as you want, no second thoughts. The ankles don't even notice it.\n\nIn the last interval, I push it and run the 600m at 3:56/km. No particular difference in the feeling from previous slightly slower sets.\n\nWork done, time to cool down. Back to easy cool down at 6:00/km. I don't even notice I'm wearing \"workout shoes\".\n\nI reach home, my feet are not tired, and my calves don't hurt. The Adios 8 did achieve what I was looking for.\n\n# The likes\n\n* Comfortable\n* Perfect to combine warm-up/cool-down with the speed session.\n* Nice grip\n* Snappy and fast.\n* Great on tight turns.\n* Easy on the feet post-workout.\n* Would happily \"race\" 5k or even 10k with them if I already didn't have the TS8 and DNE for that.\n\n# The dislikes\n\n* Adidas laces are trash. But easy to fix.\n* Top speed energy return is not as good as TS8. But is not expected to, there are some expected trade-offs on the comfort vs top-speed performance.\n\n# Do I recommend them?\n\nYES. For 60GBP this is a great addition.\n\nThey perform in the workouts, they're comfortable, and they don't cause issues when running at slow paces. Everything I wanted.\n\nIf only I had known this some months ago, I would have fewer shoes. \n\nI don't think I need something as extreme as the TS8 or that I run long enough to need full carbon-plated shoes like the Puma DNE. But who I am trying to cheat, I bought them also for a bargain.\n\nFor now (besides for 5/10k PB attempts), The Adios 8 puts my TS8 and Puma DNE in the wardrobe.",

      "yep. this shoe is basically a boston 12 as a daily trainer for anyone who remember running in low stack-height shoes pre-\\~2019. i love them for 5-8k distance speed runs \u2014 the LSP in the forefoot is enough for me at \\~90kg, and i get surprisingly good cushioning out of them for how little foam is there, but after \\~5 miles i\u2019ll get a bit of tenderness in my quads the next day if i\u2019m pushing. they\u2019re great for developing foot strength, though, as they\u2019re so damn flexible.\n\nmy only real complaint is the plastic shank \u2014 if you land *exactly* midfoot, there\u2019s an annoying plastic clacking sound you\u2019ll here. not a big deal, but i\u2019m curious how the adios 9 compare (wish they\u2019d come out stateside).",
      "Nearly as good as takumi and much more comfortable",
      "I've got about 110 miles on mine that I cannot believe how 'untouched' the outsole is. That Conti rubber is pure magic. I also got them last year on super discount - $56 USD. I've done up to 10 miles in them and they were great. I just wish the entire midsole was Lightstrike Pro. Otherwise, these are a great all around shoe.",
      "I'm on my 4th pair...I've used them as a daily trainer, plus raced from 5k upto marathons in them...I find the tremendously versatile and good value for money...a little worried about buying 9s as the drop has changed and my ageing achilles are kind of sensitive."

    "selftext": "About Me (for context) \u2022\tEasy pace: 09:00\u201308:15 \u2022\tMarathon pace: 07:00 \u2022\tThreshold: 06:25 \u2022\tHeight: 6\u20190\u201d \u2022\tWeight: 167 lb\n\n\u2e3b\n\nFirst Impressions Soft, springy, incredibly light\u2014the shoe has it all. But one thing it might not have is enough protection for long distances.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nVersatility: A True Trainer I\u2019ve used this shoe for just about everything: up to 10-mile runs, steady efforts, repeats, strides, threshold work, even the occasional recovery jog. It can do it all if you\u2019re willing to accept some trade-offs. There are better shoes for recovery. There are better shoes for workouts. But as a training shoe? This is as close to perfect as I\u2019ve found.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nWhy It Stands Out In a world of towering 40mm+ stacks and muted ground feel, the Adios 9 is refreshing\u2014even essential. It reconnects me with the ground, makes me work a little harder, and builds strength and awareness in a way max-stack shoes can\u2019t.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nThe Trade-Off: A Rough Transition The first few runs absolutely wrecked my calves. The low drop and low stack, combined with springy foam, highlighted how much I had adapted (maybe too much) to high-stack shoes. DOMS for days. But it was a wake-up call\u2014one I needed.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nA Return to Form This shoe reminds me what running used to feel like. Grounded. Responsive. Demanding, in a good way. With the bounce and softness of modern foam, it\u2019s the best of both worlds\u2014old-school feel, new-school energy.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nThe Upper: A Standout Feature The upper is easily the best I\u2019ve ever run in. It disappears on the foot, offers excellent comfort, and locks the midfoot down perfectly.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nThe Major Flaw: The Heel And now the catch. I get brutal Achilles irritation and heel blistering in this shoe. If I run two days in a row or wear anything other than thick socks, my heels get shredded. It\u2019s bad enough that I\u2019m hesitant to try the Adios Pro 4.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nDurability So Far No complaints. Zero outsole wear after plenty of use, and the midsole still feels lively. I was concerned about the new LSP foam formulation, but so far, so good. Not quite tank-like durability, but definitely not a one-run wonder either.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nFinal Thoughts: Who This Shoe Is For If you\u2019re craving something different in your rotation\u2014something light, low, springy, and form-focused\u2014this could be your next favorite shoe.

      "would say not for heel strikers as its very narrow. i experienced the same, killed my calves the first few times, coming from using evo sl as my daily and pro 4 for races",
      "Is this soft cause it has the new version of light strike pro?",
      "I agree with all the points. \n\nOver winter and spring I put in 600km into a pair of Mach 6, I\u2019ve put in 43km into the adios 9 and I did not find too much of a difference in stack between these. Looking at runrepeat there isn\u2019t much difference either. Because of this I did not find much of a difference in impact protection. \n\nOf course the Evo sl or superblast I have, come with way more stack.  \n\nCompletely agree on the heel though. I got a blister on my right heel which the shorter foot. This only became apparent when I swapped out the laces from the stock ones to the imitation aphafly laces from Amazon. While it eliminated the narrow lace feel getting a lockdown is a bit more peculiar. I wore a pair of older socks which were thick but it wore off the heel area completely. It could be that the heel cup era just aggravates this. \n\nI do like them a lot but need more runs in whether this heel issue can be eliminated. The adios pro 4 upper is pretty much the same but I\u2019ve only put 5k in them. \n\nMost of my socks are anti blister with more padding in the areas that are necessary.",
      "I have two pairs.\nThey seem to be hard to find.\nThese have been perfect for me.\nFrom intense intervals to 7 mile tempo runs.\nHard to find in the U.S. it appears \nI got both pairs from Running Warehouse.\nNo one else had them.",
      "The heel issue is the reason I\u2019ve given up on adidas shoes - had it with two different pairs I tried for long runs\u2026 tried sizing up for the second pair and still happened. I just came to the conclusion that my feet/Achilles weren\u2019t made for adidas"

      "Found a pair of adidas prime strung x2 at a local running store for $150 CAD, which seems like an ok deal\n\nCouple questions: are these illegal to use in a race? I read they are kind of unstable and can deteriorate quickly, does anyone have experiences with them?",

      "Just want to comment without making a full post did my first run in Saucony Endorphin Pro 4. I\u2019ve had the speed 4 and done 2 half marathons in them along with all my speed/interval workouts. Love the Speed 4 but it\u2019s a bit narrow in the toe box had to switch up the lacing to give me a bit of room. The Pro 4 upper is awesome. Really hugs the foot I feel like I have the room I was missing in the speed. As for how it felt, was so happy with it! When I picked up the pace doing 7x1min@3:45 it responded so well felt like I was basically gliding out there. For my first carbon plated shoe I\u2019m super happy with the purchase! Got the red color way which is pretty awesome too!",
      "I just tried the HOKA Cielo X1 2.0 as I\u2019m looking for a shoe who can generate lots of speed.\nAll I can say is that shoe is WOW. It\u2019s freaking amazing. For slower runs you should definitely look for something else. However \u2026 If you\u2019re running fast, like really fast (4:00 pace or preferably faster), it\u2019s a superb shoe and you can seriously feel the difference immediately",
      "Tempo trainers.   \nI have a three shoe rotation: triumph 21s for generic run (I've still got an unused pair), speed 3's then 4's for uptempo/speed work, and now metaspeed paris for racing. It's basically a 2 shoe rotation because I don't use the metaspeed for anything but racing and a little practice prior to.\n\nI've been happy with my speed 3s (got about 800k out of them), and 4s (got about 650k but the bottoms are getting pretty beat). No complaints, fun to run in. And I've got size 13 feet, for not a huge guy, so normal trainers can feel big and bulky, and the speeds have felt nimble.   \n  \nI can just replace them with another pair of speed 4s, but let's be honest, we're on running shoe geeks for a reason lol and we're all curious what else is out there.  \n  \nI'm partly wondering about endorphin pro 4s as it seemed they 'dumbed them down' a bit from a race shoe to make room for the elites. As best as I can tell they should have the same durability, just a bit more pop with the carbon plate.\n\nAlso boston 13s or evo SL? They seem to get really good reviews.  \nOr any other recommendation people might have?\n\nI'm not looking so much for an out and out race shoe. The metaspeeds fill that, and to be honest, even if someone was giving me free metaspeeds and I didn't care about cost or durability, it's just not a shoe I'd use much outside of all-out race effort. The speeds have filled this huge middle area where I could legitimately use it for anything from slow to race. \n\nLooking for that fun once or twice a week shoe, light, speedy, but also some level of durability. Thanks!"

    "title": "Hoka Clifton 10: First Run",
    "selftext": "Background: I'm a casual runner doing 20-30 miles a week on road and trail. No races, just collecting shoes and miles. 5 foot 6 inches at 155 lbs. I'm a mid-foot striker with some overpronation issues that can cause shin splints. I do own these, but I DID NOT pay for these shoes. These were provided to me by my employer.\n\nThe Shoe: Hooka Clifton 10. Yes, customers do say hookah -\\_- These fit true to size and I went with my usual US mens size 9 medium. The Cliftons are now at 8mm offset. They have always been a 5mm drop shoe. This is their neutral cushy daily trainer. \n\nFirst Run: Slow zone 2 recovery 4mi run on very flat streets. This is near the end of a 35mi week for me, so I need a slow and easy run. \n\nFit: The upper feels wider and roomier than the previous Clifton 9. The 9s had a few areas that pressed and rubbed against the sides of my feet so they were a no go. The extra room in the 10 is a much better fit for my feet, but I still like the fit of the Skyflow more. There isn't much going on with the upper. It's just a simple comfortable design. No lace bit or pressure points. My body temp is always very warm and my feet are always sweaty. This was a noticeably warm shoe even in low 60F degree temps. \n\nRide and Cushion: This was the exact ride I was looking for on a slow and easy recovery run. There isn't much bounce, very little energy return and the rocker is just enough to slowly transition from landing to toe off. The foam isn't too soft and squishy. This isn't an exciting shoe, but it is a comfortable walking and slow running shoe. So far, there's enough stability for my needs. I'll rotate between this and the Topo Aura for my slow runs. \n\nLikes: I like the bright colors of the Cliftons so far, soft walking and work shoe, great for easy runs. More room in the upper compared to previous version. Stable neutral shoe.\n\nDislike: Runs warm and isn't that breathable. I typically complain about the high prices for current daily trainers especially when there isn't anything very exciting or unique about a shoe. I feel like you can do just as good when buying older models like a Glycerin 21, Cumulus, or 1080. \n\nWould I Buy This: Since this was given to me, yes, I will wear it and continue to run in it. I would not want to go out and buy it at full price. Maybe in the future when the 11 comes out, then I would consider getting this at a discounted price. I prefer the ride of the Skyflow over the Clifton if I had the choice to stick with Hoka for a daily trainer. It's not a bad shoe at all, it just doesn't wow me. ",

    "selftext": "M28, 6'3\", 190lbs, typically wear sizes of 12 or 12.5 (US). Neutral runner with slight supination in both feet. Running 30-40 mpw. Primarily run trail races from half marathons up to 50kms, although I'm think about doing a road race or two next year. Easy pace is between 10:15-9:30 min/mi. Speedwork varies anywhere between 9-6:30 min/mi depending on the type of speedwork. Run 2-3 days on roads per week and 1-2 days on trails per week. 4-5 total days running per week.\n\nFirst, I want to say I don't have wide feet but my toes like to splay, which is why I went out and got these two shoes. I was tired of pinky toe rubbing and was like lets try something new.\n\nTopo Cyclone 2:\n\n* Purchased on sale for $110\n* Very light (8.1oz in a size 12 is by far the lightest shoe I've ever owned).\n* Fast, nimble, responsive.\n* Feel almost like a racing flat (Tired of all these 40+mm chunckers).\n* Great for all types of speedwork.\n* I've done anything from 400m repeats, 800m repeats, 1km repeats, strides, fartleks, and even some easier miles.\n* You can do easy miles with this shoes but they are pretty firm.\n* Haven't used them for anything more than 10km, but I think lighter runners might be able to use them for up to a half marathon.\n* I think this would be a great non-plated 5km or 10km racer.\n* The grip is surprisingly great. I recently ran in pouring rain and had no issues. Drainage also seemed pretty good.\n* Upper feels fine, no complaints.\n* The Pebax foam is very rewarding and I love that it's beaded.\n* I personally don't miss having a plate like in my many Saucony Endorphin Speeds (multiple 2 and 3's).\n* The rocker is nice but not too aggressive.\n* Good heel and midfoot lookdown while still having that great anatomical toebox.\n* I really enjoy these shoes and will definitely be getting another pair of the 2's or maybe the 3's when these die.\n\nTopo Specter 2:\n\n* Purchased for $130 during a sale earlier this year.\n* Light for their size.\n* I didn't weigh them but my guess is they probably weigh about 9.2-9.5oz in my size 12.\n* The heel bevel is egregious, but it doesn't bother me.\n* Was a little firm, but broke in quite nice at around 30 miles.\n* Use them mainly for daily training.\n* Have done one 10+ mile run and they felt great.\n* Upper feels fine, no complaints.\n* The Pebax foam is very nice and I love that it's beaded.\n* This Pebax feel slightly softer than the cyclone and not quite as responsive.\n* Nice rocker that really helps push you through your stride.\n* This shoe feels great at half marathon and marathon efforts too.\n* When you get into a groove with this shoe, you can flat out fly.\n* Good heel and midfoot lookdown while still having that great anatomical toebox.\n* I think this would be a great half marathon and marathon racer for those looking for a non-plated option with speed.\n* I personally like them a tad better than the asics superblast 1's (I know that will ruffle some feathers).\n* Only worry I have is the longevity of the rubber on the forefoot. If you look at my pictures, you'll see some wear already...so I wish the rubber was thicker on the forefoot.\n* The specter is also not the greatest for recovery miles due to it's firmness.\n* would buy these again, but if you tear through rubber, I might look elsewhere.\n\nOverall comparison between the two shoes:\n\n* The cyclone is way better for speed work, while the specter seems more tailored towards daily training and long runs with some faster miles in there.\n* Specifically: the cyclone is a great track workout and fartlek shoe, while the specter excels at half marathon and marathon efforts due to it's nice rocker and pebax foam.\n* The specter definitely feels like the cyclones higher cushioned big brother.\n* If you like shoes on the firmer side, anatomical toeboxes, and a solid all-around fit, these are two great choices.\n* I really like what topo is doing with the wide toeboxes and simple shoe designs.\n* Topo for the love of god, please develop better colorways, although I do like all specter 2 ones.\n* I do think I'm going to get a third road shoe for recovery/easy days since I don't think the specter is greatest for recovery runs.\n\nFinal thoughts: These shoes just work. Topo is doing great stuff.\n\n  \nEdit: See pictures in comments below. Not sure why they didn't upload",

Stable, solid and neither fast nor brick'ish slow, just a nice everyday trainer that help me get back into running post-PTT. I am really pleasantly surprised as I didn't expect too much but feel like they really over-deliver. Long run felt really good, some thrsh effort (4:30-4:45/k) also went down nicely.

      "6\u20191 215lb. Love SB2, especially if I\u2019m doing anything in the sub 10min/mi range or faster (basically everything but recovery). That said, for $200USD a pop, it\u2019s a lot of miles to put on shoes to use them as daily trainers. I own NB5 (2 pairs, don\u2019t ask) and hate them. They\u2019re too soft for me except for the slowest of runs. Don\u2019t need stability. After my race next week, about to go back to 40ish mpw just logging miles and eating up time on the road.\n\nWhat  do you fine folks like from ASICS just for a work horse, logging miles, type of shoe?

      "Bought Evoride Speed 2 last month for $80 - $20 coupon from the US ASICS website, finally got a chance to try it outside for 5km run. At their regular price of U$130, they are a bit steep. But with the current discount, they are really worth the price tag.\n\nThey are very light, perfect stack height, and a bit on firmer side. Good for tempo or speed training. I could see myself running 10k in them comfortably. I wish their rockers were a bit more drastic and to the back (closer to midfoot) to help with the toe-off.",

      "Three questions:\n\n1. Are there any plans to release a carbon plated shoe in the future? I understand that would go against your philosophy of natural running movement, but I feel like that addition would help solidify your place in the market, especially for us wide footers seeking a race day shoe. \n\n2. Why is the mid foot designed to be so tight/snug? Feel like that's an issue for a majority of us. At least for me, everything else about the shoe is amazing except that midfoot. \n\n3. How will you improve on the Specter 2 for the future? Personally for me, I felt like the arch support was too much for me. Could have used more snappiness (kind of what was in the Specter 1).",

    "title": "Li Ning Challenger 5 review at 87 miles.",
    "selftext": "Male, 54. 1.79m, 72 kg. Currently 19 flat 5k.\n\nA selection of other shoes I have really liked. Endorphin pro 3, Pxs v1, Next v1, Xtep 160x Pro 3.0. Qiaodan plaid 1.5. Rebellion pro v1.\n\nI'm currently going through a Chinese shoe phase and picked up a pair of Li Ning challenger 5 after seeing a favourable review. I have far too many shoes, but given the price that these are available for, I couldn't resist. \n\nUpper:  \n\nA light but resilient, very breathable synthetic mesh. It's not soft but far from coarse. Comfortable in use. This is quite a fitted 'race style' upper, so no frivolous plushness here. The tongue is fully gusseted and has sufficient padding to prevent lace bite. The fit is reasonably narrow but not excessively so. If you can get in the Adidas SL2 you will be fine here. The heel counter tends towards the softer end of the spectrum but has some structure. I am someone who has some heel/Achilles sensitivity but these shoes are fine for me. You will have to loosen the laces as this isn't the easiest shoe to get on. Once you are in lock down is excellent with zero heel lift for me. Fit is very true to size. \n\nMidsole:\n\nApproximate stack heights measured by me for a UK10/US11/EU45 - 40mm/32mm.\nThere are 2 layers of foam sandwiching a full scooped carbon plate. Li Nings 'Superboom' foam is used and this appears to be the softer upper layer. The lower layer is slightly firmer and appears to be the previous generation 'boom' foam. The midsole feels good from the get go but after 10 to 15 miles feels even better. These shoes are rather soft and compressive but with a high degree of rebound too - Very responsive and a delight to run in. The shoes are moderately rockered and the plate is not too stiff. They are tuned just right to handle a full range of paces and feel good at all of them. I have run paces ranging from 10 minutes per mile down to strides at 4.00 min/mile pace in these with no issues. You could quite happily race in these. Despite being a softer foam, there is zero creasing visible at this mileage. It should last well. Stability is average.\n\nOutsole:\n\nA decent coverage of some type of rubber. I toe off quite hard and I am starting to see a little wear in that region but nothing unusual. This appears to be reasonably durable and I expect to get at least 300 miles out of the shoes.\n\nWeight:\n\nRace shoe light... 219g in my EU45\n\nPrice:\n\nI just purchased a second pair from Ali Express during a recent sales event. I paid \u00a356 inclusive of shipping and taxes. Prices will vary depending on sales events but you won't be paying a lot for these (depending on your local tariff situation).\n\nOverall: \n\nConsider these an excellent super trainer/fast day shoe. Compared to other shoes of the same category I have tried, I prefer these to Boston 12 and Endorphin Speed 3 shoes. Highly recommended.",

      "To add some things:\n\nThe top layer is Li-nings super boom foam, Peba. \nThe bottom layer is NOT the old boom foam (beaded peba) its their very old tpe foam used in the challenger 3 for example. It adds nice stability with some energy return.\n\nFor that price the shoe is amazing, it plays in the same league as the endorphin speed series, adidas Boston, asics magic speed etc.\n\nStability is better than it feels like, took some videos of it and it was as stable as a endorphin trainer, or even the guide 17, while it feels very dynamic and neutral.",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/2zqvobsmnnze1.jpeg?width=576&auto=webp&s=b029c7e4f13add381a1de9afd5622baa3c264ef8\n\nI\u2019m a 32-year-old midfoot striker, 200 lbs, and I run 20 to 30 miles a week. I went through three pairs of On Cloudmonsters, which I loved for their unique foam feel and stylish design. They were actually my first pair of running shoes that weren\u2019t from the clearance rack. But they always felt a bit narrow, and I just lived with it. After that, I picked up the Salomon Aero Glide 3, which gave my toes more room and introduced a completely different midsole feel. Still, even with the extra width, I started to realize that what I really needed after tough sessions was a true recovery shoe.\n\nThese shoes aren\u2019t flashy. They\u2019re not racing shoes, and they might not even be your best bet for a daily trainer. But if you\u2019re a bigger runner, need room up front, and want something that feels like a hug for your feet, this shoe delivers.\n\nWhat I Love:\n\n**Fit for the Wide Feet**: The 4E width is legit. No break-in period, no pinky toe squeeze, just comfort. I have very wide and short feet for my size(6ft, 200lbs). I usually wear 8.5s or 9s for every other shoe, but because this is an x-wide, I think I could've gotten away with even getting 8s. \n\n**Plush Cushioning**: The Fresh Foam X midsole feels heavenly. It is soft but still stable. It\u2019s the kind of foam you didn\u2019t know you needed until your legs are beat.\n\n**Smooth Ride**: Despite the bulk, it rolls surprisingly well for recovery runs. It encourages you to slow down and enjoy the movement.\n\nWhat They\u2019re Not:\n\n**Race Day Ready**: These aren\u2019t built for speed. You\u2019ll feel the weight if you try to push pace.\n\n**Everyday Workhorses?**: For some, maybe. But if you like responsiveness and versatility, you might want to rotate these with something snappier.\n\nThese shoes may not be the sexiest to look at, but wow, do they feel sexy. If you\u2019re a heavier runner or just someone craving comfort on easy or recovery days, these are worth every step. I didn\u2019t know running recovery could feel this good.",

    "title": "First Run Impression: Skechers SKX Aero Burst",
    "selftext": "Context: 40M, 195 lb/88 kg, midfoot striker, neutral/slight supination, 24.5-minute 5K, 2-hour half\n\nOver the past two years, I\u2019ve become a total Skechers Performance nerd. I didn\u2019t choose this life. I just got the Speed Beast and it all spiraled from there.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve run in everything they\u2019ve put out since 2021 or so. One of the shoes I put absolutely MONSTROUS miles on was the Max Road 6, a shoe I rather enjoyed but always found super heavy and a little \u2026 isolating.\n\nWhen I saw the Aero Burst (and its Aero brethren, the Spark and the Tempo) at The Running Event last year, I knew these would be a day one purchase for me. So how did they feel, and how do they compare to the Max Road that came before?\n\nMy run today was a tiny little recovery outing, as that\u2019s all I had time for. Just two miles, 8:50-something pace. My first impressions of the Aero Burst are:\n\n1. ROAD FEEL!!\n2. Ludicrous amounts of grip\n3. Loud, but not too \u201cclonky\u201d\n4. Stable as hell\n5. Buttery smooth\n\nIn short, these are my new default road running shoe on Strava.\n\nI was blown away at how connected these shoes feel, even though they are immensely cushiony and buttery. They feel at once more cushioned and more agile than the Max Road, and they feel almost shockingly connected to the road.\n\nThe engineered mesh upper is so much more breathable than I thought it would be. The Max Road was such a heavy, insulated, hot shoe (which I kind of enjoyed during the winter runs, to be fair). But the Aero Burst is breezy, light, snappy, airy, fast. \n\nThe dual-density Hyper Burst Ice feels perfect to me, and is just what I\u2019m looking for in a shoe like this. Anyone who\u2019s run in the Ride 11 (also love that shoe and still take it out frequently) or the Max Road 6 knows Hyper Burst Ice is a wonderfully bouncy and comfortable midsole, but it\u2019s been improved upon here with a noticeably greater energy return. \n\nThis is not a slow shoe, though I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll feel nice as a recovery option. \n\nIs Arch Fit still there? Yes, it is. I love it, others hate it, you can always swap the insole if you want. It feels less pronounced in this shoe; I think they toned it down a bit.\n\nThe Goodyear outsole is even grippier now, by the way. Makes me feel like Spider-Man, I love it.\n\nCarbon-infused H plate is similar in feel to previous generations of these shoes. Not propulsive, but stabilizing and a little bit snappy. Coupled with the Hyper Arc geometry and the dual-density foam, it helps these shoes generate a way faster turnover than you might expect.\n\nLong story short, I am really looking forward to taking these out on a long run this weekend. If I uncover anything else about them, I\u2019ll update this space!\n\nGreat shoes. If Skechers can survive this VC acquisition, and if Skechers Performance is allowed to thrive, this Aero line bodes very well for the future.\n\nAlso they\u2019re only $150, and the Spark is only $130?! These feel just as nice as my beloved Neo Vistas, and I would honestly have paid $180 for these too. They are premium, high quality shoes, and I recommend you pick them up.",

    "title": "Superblast 2 after 200 miles",
    "selftext": "\n**About Me:** Heavier male, 6'1\" (185 cm), clean form, naturally high cadence even at slow paces, midfoot striker.\n\n**Precise Mileage:** 207 miles\n\n**Fit:** True to size. I'm a bit small for my size\u2014probably closer to a 10.75 in men's\u2014but I still think sticking with size 11 (my TTS for running shoes) was the right call.\n\n**Usage:** Everything: easy runs, long runs (up to 15 miles), tempos, intervals, hill repeats, recovery (shuffling feet), races, the works. Set a half marathon PR and ran multiple 10k races. \n\n**Comparison:** It\u2019s really one of a kind. Excels at everything. A true jack of all trades, master of all. The only shoe that rivals its versatility is the Evo SL, imo. \n\n**Upper:** Light and breathable with great lockdown. No lace bite. Extremely comfortable with just the right amount of padding.\n\n**Midsole:** Phenomenal. Initially, it felt stiff and a bit harsh\u2014fine for short runs, but left me needing recovery time. Around the 40 miles mark, it softened just slightly, enough to turn that stiffness into rebound. Perfect for long runs. As a heavier runner, my feet usually get fatigued deep into long runs\u2014like the foam gives up. Not with the Superblast. I still feel protected even after double digits. This thing is a long-run machine.\n\n**Midsole Spec:** Dual-layer setup. Most of it is FF Turbo+ (PEBA\u2014bouncy and resilient). There\u2019s also a thin layer of FF Blast+ (an EVA blend, to my knowledge).\n\n**Performance:** This shoe is covertly fast. I\u2019m used to it now, but early on I was consistently surprised to see how fast I was going relative to my perceived effort. It helps you lock into a fast, comfortable pace and hold it. Not as aggressive as a plated racer, but still impressive. I suspect FF Blast+ may act like an EVA soft plate, similar to what Adidas did in the Supernova lineup.\n\n**Grip:** Amazing. I\u2019ve run on wet European concrete sidewalks\u2014super slick\u2014and this outsole is one of the most secure I\u2019ve felt. Easily up there with Continental rubber. If Continental is better, it\u2019s not by much.\n\n**Durability:** This thing is a tank. Virtually no wear. Still feels and performs like it did at the 40-mile mark when it broke in. A few midsole creases, but that\u2019s it. Outsole looks almost new\u2014even side-by-side with a brand-new pair. I\u2019m a heavier runner, but my clean form probably helps reduce excess wear.\n\n**Support:** Stable neutral. Great for true neutral runners or those with mild overpronation. The midsole has subtle geometry-based stability: medial side bulges slightly, lateral curves inward. The heel also has mild bucket-seat structure. Really helps when form starts to break down late in long runs or on downhill segments during hill repeats. When my legs are trashed, this is the shoe I trust.\n\n**Negatives:** Price, availability, and break-in period. It may feel too harsh for some runners at first. Even with decent step-in comfort, it took 40 miles for the edge to come off\u2014and even then it was a subtle improvement. Just enough to shift from harsh to \u201cjust right.\u201d\n\n**Misc:** The \u201cpeach\u201d midsole pair (207 miles) felt slightly stiffer than the mint green when both were new. The mint green feels closer to the peach after break-in. Possible reasons: (1) dye interacts differently with the PEBA foam, (2) natural variation within QC range of acceptance, (3) I\u2019m misremembering\u2014or a mix of these. Either way, the difference was minor. I haven\u2019t run in the mint green yet; I\u2019m just going off step-in feel.\n\n**Final Verdict:** Probably my favorite non-plated shoe ever\u2014maybe tied for first with the Evo SL.",

      "I love my SB2, I did all my long runs over the winter and ran a marathon in them in March and they held up great. I've got over 300 miles in mine and they still feel the same as they did once they broke in, you get the price back in durability. I've transitioned away from Asics and mainly run in Boston 12's for daily/tempo runs and Takumi Sen 10 for workouts, and these are great recovery shoes for the day after a long run or a hard workout. Superblast feel like marshmallows after a few runs in either of those lol. I've got another pair sitting on the shelf and I'm debating whether to keep them or resale them because I only wear my current pair now about once a week and they still feel like they have a lot of life left in them lol.\n\nA note about Asics sizing though, always go by CM size. I'm a true 28.5 which in most brands is a US 10.5, but in Asics 28.5 is US 11. Asics does funky conversions with their sizes around US 9-12 which is why some people will recommend you size down, while others feel they need to size up and others feel TTS. Just go by CM size in Asics.",

I know a lot of folks rely on Skechers for quality work shoes at affordable prices and knowing Private Equity, the shoes are about to get a lot worse in quality and more expensive."

    "selftext": "Main Points:\n\n\\- Love it. This might be my new race shoe.\n\n\\- USD$ \\~215 after all taxes via the official store @ Aliexpress. US consumers, get ready for taxes.\n\n\\- Sock-fit; Comfortable, slightly snug, but roomier toebox than the Adios Pro 4. Fits just like the Alphafly 3 for me.\n\n\\- PEBA midsole, firmer and less bouncy than the Adios Pro 4, but rolls nicely and is quite responsive.\n\n\\- Neutral shoe, but the midsole cutout was moved from medial to lateral side, which might benefit runners that suffer from overpronation. That can be a point of attention for oversupinators.\n\n\\- Sock fit, not particularly light (\\~230g US10.5), breathable upper, hard to put on (triathletes might be annoyed).\n\n\\- CPU outsole is fantastic as usual. Durable, grippy and light.\n\n\\- Wide outsole, but insole area gets slightly narrow near the midfoot. I had no issues but some people might get bothered by that.- Sizing: just like the Alphafly 3 and Adios Pro 4 for me.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI've recently purchased the new version of Qiaodan's flagship marathon racer - Feying Plaid 2. It cost me \\~R$ 1.300, which was roughly USD $216.\n\nI own a bunch of other shoes from this same brand (PB 4, Plaid 1, Plaid 1.5 and now Plaid 2) and I briefly had an Adios Pro 4 that I ended up selling.  All chinese shoes were purchased through the official store in Aliexpress and the AP4 through Adidas.\n\nI had 2 training sessions with the Plaid 2:\n\n10x400 @ \\~3k-5k pace\n\n10k easy + 3k @ marathon to half marathon pace. The shoe feels nice @ vo2max effort, but really shines in cruising speed.\n\nThere are a few main differences from the plaid 1.5 to the version 2:\n\n1. The new midsole (PEBA) is significantly stiffer than the one found in the Plaid 1.5 (PTEE), which is extremely similar to the feel of the Adios Pro 4.\n2. The midsole cutout was moved from the medial to the lateral side, which in turn turns the pronation bias towards a slightly supination bias during landing.\n3. Upper got slightly snuggier, but there's a bit more space near the big toe. The opening is much smaller now, putting the shoe on is tougher. Triathletes might suffer during T2.\n4. There's a narrowing near the midfoot that might be troublesome for some people. I have wide-ish feet and I felt the difference, but it did not bother me while running.\n5. Ride is much less bouncy, but feels super responsive and still quite comfortable. It's more stable than the previous version, specially in longer races. This might be my new race shoe.\n\n[Qiaodan Plaid 2](https://preview.redd.it/fbj4oycruyye1.jpg?width=1219&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d3199dc550656eb566483ac010b86c91390a4c1)\n\n[Plaid 2 \\(Green, US10.5\\) and Plaid 1.5 \\(US10\\) Medial view ](https://preview.redd.it/qtxmbaktuyye1.jpg?width=921&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=996e5e6fce88bc5f04c47c88cd2faae2e4b4f1d0)\n\n[Plaid 2 \\(Green, US10.5\\) and Plaid 1.5 \\(US10\\) top view](https://preview.redd.it/5nk19qdvuyye1.jpg?width=913&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08b7a0c4a07487fb1e3142adb512c7825aee310b)\n\n[CPU Outsole](https://preview.redd.it/tc8bxvvwuyye1.jpg?width=685&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8cec292e663f184b47fb09d2ec1e263a7c2f09c)",

      "I loved my two plaid 1.5 sandi'm curious with this one too so this is very helpful. Based on your review, i think i really am be more biased towards 1.5 still. I already find it a bit narrow for my feet and if 2.0 is narrower on some areas that I have a problem already, i think i'm good with 1.5 as a speed day/non PR race days option for now. But i'm still curious so i think i'll buy these by end of 2025 after my current hold for any new shoe purchase haha",

      "I just ran my 2nd sub 3 marathon in Boston in the Plaid 2.0. Was definitely the only person wearing them out there (as far as I could tell)! I loved the 1.0 and 1.5 and was worried that the 2.0 would be too firm but they turned out ok for me. And yes they are extremely hard to get on!"

      "Conspiracy theory: the adizero evo sl was invented to finish off the old lightstrike pro formula. Remember when the SL20/sl20.2 OG lightstrike shoes showed up all over the place in discount shoe stores? Well the pro 3 had been on sale for a long time and with adidas changing the formula of lightstrike pro for the 4s, they needed to finish off the old foam... This this partly explains why it's  priced so well and also to a certain extent why they did the limited release, they needed to drive up demand and hype similar to the superblast.\n\nI bet we see them super cheap once adidas ditches the old lightstrike formula!",

    "selftext": "Me: 39, 5'11\", 185lbs. Averaging around 40mpw, 3k-5k ft vertical, with a mixture of road and trail. Low aerobic/Z2 pace is around 9:30-10:00 min/mile. Right foot is wide (approaching 4E), left foot a tad longer. Light heel to midfoot striker. High cadence.\n\nCurrent other road shoes: NB Rebel v4, Novablast 4, Superblast 2\n\nI have very little history with Salomon. I've tried on their trail offerings, but much akin to La Sportiva, they are often incredibly narrow. Recently, those brands seem to be trying to capture a more modern/broader audience.\n\nFit: These run quite large. Boston 12 kind of large. I'm 11.5-12US in nearly every shoe, but an 11 in these. 10.5 were okay, but the last is still a bit snug in the midfoot and I appreciate the extra space. Go half to full size down. Upper is... decent. Not difficult for me to get a good lockdown.\n\nRide: 2 runs in (1x5 mile and 1x10km) and I totally love this foam. It is about as soft as I can tolerate without going too far. For reference, I returned the Novablast 5 recently because it felt like lifeless marshmallow. These are cushy, but damn they have some pop. They do seem to push me a bit faster, but I think they'd be fine for anything but the fully recovery paces. Rocker is present, but not too aggressive. There is a bit of flex which gives an overall smoothness to the ride.\n\nTraction: First run was in wet conditions and light rain. I've heard some reviews mention grip problems but I had zero. YMMV.\n\nStability: my left foot/arch is weaker and can be an issue where shoes are medial-biased. These aren't crazy stable, but they do have some light stability features. As a result, I've experienced zero issues over my first 2 runs. That said, I haven't taken them for a long run.\n\nSo far I'm really impressed. I could see this becoming a new favorite daily trainer. My feet are on the milder end of wide/high volume, and I think truly wide feet may want to look elsewhere. Happy to answer any follow up questions I can.",

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/9jlaw9f56wye1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b07f794e645a4009cabecec1c9a0f6534b34888\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g6jl10c66wye1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4280503741256ea569a49dec7a1cbece8f6c7d85\n\n**About Me:**\u00a0I'm 26 years old and recently started running in December. I weigh an avg. of 140 lbs and am 6'1.\n\nBecause this is the first shoe I have ever purchased for the purpose of running, I have little experience with other running shoes, so here are my thoughts on the Novablast 5 after 50km as a new runner. From what others have said to me, I believe myself to be a forefoot striker.\n\nI typically run 30-40km a week, with my runs averaging 5-10km (@ about 6:40/km), and am planning to prepare for a half-marathon in August. Nonetheless, here are my first thoughts after 50km!\n\nPicture of the outsole is taken @ 57km.\n\n**Upper:**\u00a0I do have wider feet than average and found the Novablast 5 upper to be very accommodating and TTS in my standard US size 10.5, with ample room during my longer runs for toe splay and expanding. I didn't pay attention to keeping the shoe clean, but washing it, and dirt seemed to come off nicely. I will also say that while the upper isn't as soft or premium feeling, it has great ventilation, and my feet didn't feel any sort of hot spots or overheating throughout my runs.\n\nThe highlight of the upper for me has to be the lock-in feel and stiff heel counter, the heavy padding, tongue (while it's not padded, it provides a close and unbothering fit), and the lacing system allowed my feet to get the perfect feel and lockdown. Not to mention, the laces were perfect and never went undone even once without double lacing.\n\nI live in Canada, and the shoe was definitely not warm during the late winter runs, and I found that whenever this shoe did get wet, it didn't take very long for it to become dry again. I am very satisfied with the upper, even though it doesn't feel premium or knit-like.\n\n**Midsole:**\u00a0I was worried about starting to run with a \"max cushion\" shoe, but this shoe didn't give me that feeling throughout my run. The shoe could've been more stable for my preferences and when picking up the pace or speed, but as long as I kept my pace consistent, I did not have any issues. The shoe for me did not feel very compressed each run and has been lively from the get-go, there is a little bit of groundfeel in the forefoot, but it feels more like a nice gentle push rather than an impact to the ground. I would say so far, the midsole is quite durable and doesn't show much wear currently. I will say the one complaint I have about this midsole is that it does push me to run faster than I want at times. I find myself pushing my speed more in this shoe each run. I have been seeking other running shoe options to help with slower runs.\n\nThis shoe also firmed up a lot during my winter runs, and at times, I actually enjoyed the firmer presence of the midsole during these runs.\n\n**Outsole:**\u00a0The outsole on this shoe confuses me. Throughout my runs and mileage, I can say that this outsole is 100% very durable and can take a punch, impact, road, or whatever is thrown at it; that's a positive for this outsole. HOWEVER, this outsole's traction was much less to be desired for me. I found during my winter runs on light rocks, ice, salt, and other things that this shoe sent me sliding sometimes, and even during the summer, I have had times where the outsole just can't seem to grip the ground very well. I am pleased with the durability of this shoe, but the traction is a huge turn-off for me. Probably not the best shoe if you live in rainy conditions or plan to use this shoe during the winter. Treadmill traction was very good!\n\n**Conclusion:**\u00a0The Novablast 5 has performed great and has really opened my eyes and improved my enjoyment of running, turning a slight interest into an addictive hobby! If other newer runners are looking at this shoe as a versatile daily trainer and wondering if they should get it, GO FOR IT! However, if you're looking for a shoe to use for walking around and commuting around the city, I don't believe this is a great option; it very much feels like a true performance running shoe.\n\nIt's a great shoe for me in the summer and on the treadmill at the campus gym, but I will 100% be investing in a trail runner for the winter; the traction is just too much of a gamble here in Canada.\n\nPrice is great at $180 CAD and very reasonable, colorways are great, and I don't regret picking white haha! I'll be happy to answer questions anyone has about the shoe or my experiences as a new runner, so please ask away!\n\n**Edit:** Added images.",

      "Glad I'm not the only one with the same feeling whenever I try a slow pace with the Novablast 5. My average pace is between 6.5-7min/km and the Novablast 5 for me doesn't like anything slower and always pushes me faster. For slow paces I bought a Gel Nimbus 26 which works better and for an all rounder shoe that won't mind my slow, moderate or fast pace I got a New Balance 1080v14.",

    "selftext": "About me: 25M, 75KG, size 11 us , current marathon is 3:21 but I'm training for a sub 3 in Valencia. Current Hm time is 1:28. Running around 50-70km per week right now. Easy pace around 5:40-5:20min/km\n\nOkay so I needed a new easy/long distance shoe, had the magmax and glycerin max in my list the vomero being the last option ... I needed new shoes for this weekend long run Wich consisted in a super easy 20km run (6:00/km-5:40/km) as I was pacing a friend on his longest distance for his first marathon. The only easy/max cushion shoe on my size in my local running store were the vomero 18. I tried them on expecting nothing and they felt amazing so I pulled the trigger.\n\nUpper: it felt quite thick with the padded tounge and was a bit concerned about how much breathability they had as I live in an extremely hot a humild coastal city in mexico (30\u00b0c with 85+humidity at 6am), during the 2 hour run they felt great with no overheating Wich was a pleasant surprise, fit wise they felt a bit snug for my wide fit when I first lace them up but when running I didn't notice that snug fit anymore. So upper was better than expected\n\nMidsole: man they really blew me away, the balance of zoom X and react X is perfect at least for me, I had to pick up the pace during this 20km run up to 4:30/km and they felt unexpectedly responsive, but of course this Is no workout shoe. When I cruised in around 6min/km they felt also amazing highly protective and the geometry kept me rolling effortlessly.\n\nOutsole: no complains and felt quite good all tho I did notice a it of wear for justo 20km.\n\nConclusions: highly recommend this shoe , felt amazing at slow paces and good when I picked up the pace a bit. I've seen reviews saying they need more stack on the forefoot but I don't think that's the case with this shoe, previously owning the invincible 1 and 3 I did felt that those shoes needed more on the forefoot. I'm excited to give this shoes another spin and add more km to them ! ",

I\u2019m running faster, working less. My hip doesn\u2019t hurt. I love them but I have only had the chance to run in them a few times (5-12k) because I\u2019ve been backpacking a lot recently.

    "title": "ASICS Metaspeed Sky Paris - after 100km",
    "selftext": "I picked up a pair of ASICS Metaspeed Sky Paris when they were on sale (15% off) after hearing some great things about them.\n\nI\u2019m a 39 year old male currently training for a marathon and looking to get a time between 3.10 - 3.20.\n\nI\u2019m currently running 5km - 19.40, 10km 41.10, half Marathon 1.35km. Running around 70km a week.\n\nI own the ASICS Superblast 2 and was really impressed with them, so wanted to try the Metaspeed Sky Paris.\n\nThe first two pictures show the shoes after my first run of 15km and the others are after 100km.\n\nHere\u2019s my thoughts.\n\nUpper and fit - the upper is really well designed and breathable. It\u2019s a very narrow shoe, that suits me, but I could see it being an issue for other people. Even though it is narrow, there is quite a lot of room in the toe box, and I felt that they fit true to size for me.\n\nThe laces are excellent on this shoe. I almost always use a runners loop, but had no need to here. The laces lock really tight and there is no slippage at all, they are the best laces on a running shoe I\u2019ve come across. The tongue is good, I did think it was slightly too wide when I first got the shoe, but I didn\u2019t have any issue with it.\n\nMidsole and plate - this is probably the thing that I found most interesting about this shoe. The midsole and plate do not feel super soft like a lot of the current super race shoes. They actually felt stiff in comparison to the Adidas Pro 4 for example. The shoe doesn\u2019t feel hard like a 5km shoe would, but there was a noticeable difference to some other shoes I\u2019ve worn. You can also feel the stiffness of the plate too, and after my first run I started to get a blister on my right foot pad, I actually considered selling the shoe because of this, but I\u2019m really happy I didn\u2019t.\n\nAfter some initial runs, the foam definitely softened a bit and the shoes became really comfortable.\n\nThere is something that I have to mention though. I don\u2019t feel like this feels like a fast shoe when you have it on\u2026\u2026but when you look at your times it definitely is. For example, I feel like the Adidas Pro 4 really feels fast and propels you along the road. I don\u2019t get that feeling with the Sky Paris, but when I look at my times, I can effortlessly run at my marathon pace and faster in this shoe. It\u2019s a fast shoe, without feeling fast if that makes sense. I\u2019ve found this to be a brilliant shoe for my 5-15km tempo runs and longer interval runs. The plate gives a lot of return and running at speed feels easy.\n\nOutsole - the foam on the bottom of the shoes doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019ll last for a long time, but I guess it\u2019s not designed for daily use. The grip is great and I feel super secure on all road terrain. I\u2019ve been lucky enough that there has not been a lot of rain where I am recently, so I\u2019ve only really ran in dry conditions, but they\u2019ve held up really well after 100km. The foam feels just as good now as it did at 50km.\n\nAdditional thought - this shoe is super light and you notice this on foot. Compared to my long run shoes I can barely notice these on foot.\n\nI\u2019m not a fan of the colour/design of this particular model, I\u2019d love ASICS to come out with a few alternative colours. But with their new like of shoes dropping, this might not happen.\n\nIf there is a drop in price for this shoe when the new model comes out, they could be a steal.\n\nAfter a poor first impression I\u2019ve been really impressed with this shoe. I\u2019m planning on using the AP4 for the marathon, but if I couldn\u2019t, I\u2019d be more than happy to have the Metaspeed Sky Paris on foot. They are a brilliant race shoe.",

      "Great review and definitely agreed with everything you said. The shoe doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel fast\u201d until you look at your times and realize the pace your at. \n\nYour shoe looks new for 100KM! I have the red color way and around the same mileage and mine look trashed.",
      "Love these shoes, I\u2019m on my second pair. Have a wide foot and was surprised they seem to fit. Vaporflys don\u2019t fit me, and I tried new Puma Fast-R and it\u2019s super light but fit terribly (too narrow). I have Hoka rocket x2 and they are a nice shoe w 500 miles on them, but sky Paris is lighter and faster. Only negative is I\u2019m about 140 miles into my first pair and they are starting to feel a little soft. \n\nReally looking forward to new Metaspeed Ray!!",
      "This convinced me of giving these shoes a proper chance. They felt a bit over aggressive on my first run. Will slowly add more mileage and start racing some 10k races in them."

Being a big fan of the Vectiv Pro 2 and 3, I decided to give the Vectiv Enduris 4 a try to be more of a \"trail daily trainer\" and it's really nice. Obviously, noticeably heavier and not as dynamic and exciting as the VP2 and not as bouncy and propulsive as the VP3, but it's very solidly built, stable, comfortable, and still nimble enough to handle most trail terrains. Will rotate this with the Tomir 2.0 and the Norda 001 for the easy \"daily\" trail runs.",

      "I got a pair of Craft Nordlite Ultra's on super discount from REI. I paid $79, but saw they went down to $49 before that colorway (orange/blue/white) sold out. I was looking for a road/trail hybrid and these seemed to fit the bill. BLUF: Meh. Seriously, these shoes are just ok. The upper fit is terrible. I needed to replace the shoe laces and replaced with an old set of 'sausage' laces from the PI E:Motion Trail N1. That helped.\n\nAbout the Cr midsole foam which online reviewers raved about, its very average IMO. It's protective but not super soft and virtually zero energy return. I do believe it will prove to be durable.\n\nThe ride is firm and protective. Not much bounce. They are quite heavy @ 300g for US size 9.\n\nThe one shining spot is the outsole. I've got about 80K on them and there is literally no sign of wear whatsoever. The small lugs feel perfect on the road and provide good traction on the trails. However, b/c the upper is so sloppy, I would never use them on a serious trail run, only fire roads and buffed out trails linking road segments.\n\nOverall, I'd give this shoe a 3.75/5. Not terrible, but nothing to bring me back to Craft. I usually try and get between 300-400k on my training shoes before tossing them and I see no reason why the Nordlite Ultra's won't get there. If there's one bright spot, they appear to be built like nordic tanks and will likely get tossed simply because I'm ready for something new.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lc7yj6zagkye1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0688e6a93aa17f5c521043d2cd80683ed56375d5",

      "Neo Zen sizing?  I've read lot of people say to size down 1/2 size due to loose upper, but others say true to size. I have slightly wide feet so I'm hesitant to size down if the toe box is standard or narrow.",
      "I bought a pair of On Cloud 6s since having loved my WP Cloudrunner 2s for the last 9 months but I wanted something not WP and more breathable for the summer months. However 2 days in I find they are pushing my right foot inwards to the point of leaving a mark and blistering the side of my heel. I can't decide if this is an overall fit issue or is it part of breaking in? I've never had this happen with any other shoes before but really like the speed lacing and lightness of them so wary of returning them too soon incase they just need to be broken in! If anyone has had similar issues or advice would love to hear thoughts",
      "I was a silly goose and got a pair of running shoes in my street shoe size and I have blisters on blisters. I wear running socks every time. I realized when I ran my half marathon that it was probably because my feet were swelling and that's why I have all my blisters. They have, maybe, 150 miles on them and I don't want to get new ones just yet."

For the price of this shoe, I think it\u2019s decent value.\n\nSTREAKFLY: probs my favourite shoe of the lot, meant of speedwork but I wear it even for slightly longer distances (above 10k), very light, feels like there\u2019s nothing on my feet, fits very well, upper is super breathable and comfortable enough, the thin slab of ZoomX again is the star of the show, the only big issue with this shoe is definitely its durability, not visible from the pic but the upper is slowly separating from the midsole but I like it so much I might get another pair of GOAT.\n\nINFINITY RN 4: really regret buying these shoes, I got them when I was fairly new to running, the upper is very warm, it\u2019s made of a thick knit and I live in a very hot climate so not the best pairing, this shoe also gives me crazy pressure in the middle tongue area, I feel like it might be a sizing issue so maybe I\u2019m being unfair, the shoe is also very heavy, you feel that heft wearing it, the midsole is reactX, the midsole just under ZoomX in the Nike range, I believe it\u2019s an okay foam but honestly not my favourite, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s soft of responsive enough (the gap between it and ZoomX is too high imo) I will probs give away this shoe as I straight up don\u2019t like it.\n\nVOMERO 17: a very well rounded shoe overall, although the invincible run 3 outshines it, the vomero 17 still holds its weight, the upper is a mesh that doesn\u2019t stretch much but is not uncomfortable by any means, vomero is also breathable so that\u2019s always a plus for me, the weight is absolutely fine, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s heavy, the best part of the shoe is its midsole which is a mix of zoom x (upper part closer to your feet) which gives a good amount of bounce ( absolutely noticeable despite the ZoomX being half of the midsole) and the bottom foam is cushlon I believe, the mix brings a more stability focused approach and I think it works very well, absolutely satisfied with the shoe, ps. I tried the vomero 18 which has a ZoomX and reactX mix and I felt that the midsole of that shoe was better, it is also a bigger stack height all round but this means Nike is taking a different approach to the vomero line as it was never about max cushioning, I will say tho the upper of the vomero 18 is superior to the vomero 17 in my opinion as it\u2019s breathable knit (I will always prefer knit over mesh).

    "selftext": "I unfortunately don't have pics of my VF2 or 3, but I've gotten well over 100+ miles in each and about 25-30 miles in the VF4. Sorry for the long writeup, but I have lots of thoughts on all these shoes lol.\n\n**About me:** 5'4, \\~120lb, size 9W in Nike shoes (8.5 is my regular shoe size). Half marathon pace about 6:25/mile or about 4:00/km. I love trying supershoes and am very picky about which shoes I wear. I used to prefer a plush, bouncy shoe with a lot of upwards energy return (like the Alphafly 2), but now I prefer a more rockered, aggressive ride. My current favourite supershoe is the ASICS Metaspeed Edge Paris.\n\n**Vaporfly 2:** The VF2 were the first supershoe I ever tried. Beyond the initial shock of the insane energy return shoes could have, I think they're a really fun shoe especially if you're feeling good and up on your toes. They're the most versatile supershoe I've tried to date and I've literally used them for everything from the mile to the marathon. After trying many other supershoes, these probably wouldn't be my first choice for a marathon -- I'd probably want something more cushioned -- but they're still loved by pros & amateurs alike for a reason. I don't have any complaints/comments about breathability/fit as it was not anything I noticed or had issues with.\n\nMost of my issues with the VF2 aren't about the ride or energy return. The real problem is the lack of comfort and how harsh the shoe can feel. I think the VF2 works really well if you\u2019re running efficiently, staying up on your toes, and pushing the pace. But going into my last marathon, I was coming off an injury and admittedly pretty undertrained. I knew the marathon would not be pleasant for the last 10 miles regardless, but once my form started to break down in the later miles, the shoe just didn\u2019t offer the support I needed. Instead of helping me through the race, it felt like I was fighting against it. On top of that, every time I wear the VF2, I wake up the next day with sore, stiff calves and feet which is a level of discomfort I don\u2019t get with other supershoes.\n\nBeyond those complaints, I do think the shoe is awesome & I wouldn't hesitate to wear these for a race half marathon or below. It is surprisingly durable and I have well over 150+ miles on each of my pairs (I have two pairs hehe). Beyond some minor scuff marks and dirt, both pairs look and feel practically brand new. The foam is well in tact and hasn't fallen apart at all unlike some other Nike supershoes I've tried (ahem AF 2 and 3). Overall, I'd say an 8/10.\n\n**Vaporfly 3:** I was really looking forward to these as I hoped they would maintain the aggressive, energetic ride of the VF2, but be a bit more accommodating and slightly more cushioned for those longer distances. I was really impressed by the breathability and how lightweight the shoes were, but unfortunately besides that, I was disappointed in the VF3.\n\nFirstly, I found the fit really off. The shoe was my proper size, but even with a runner's knot, double knotting, etc, I could never get a proper lockdown and got a lot of heel slippage. Also, the bottom doesn\u2019t have continuous rubber on the forefoot and it makes the shoe feel less stable.\n\nSecondly, while the VF3 is noticeably more cushioned the V2, it lacked the benefits you'd typically expect from added foam. It didn't soften ground impact in a meaningful way, nor did it provide any bounce or energy return. Instead, the foam just made the shoe dull and unresponsive -- like it absorbed the energy instead of giving it back. It did feel more comfortable than the V2 as I didn't have any calf/feet tightness after wearing it. it didn't give me any supershoe feeling and instead felt like I was wearing a weirdly fit, slightly uncomfortable daily trainer.\n\nLastly, the durability is lacking. Instead of being a continuous bottom like V2, it has ridges which started to wear down quickly. The foam started to fall apart after about 80-ish miles & it lost what little bounce/energy return it had around then too which isn't what I'd want from a $250 supershoe. I know you can get these for significantly cheaper now -- I've seen them go for like $160 on a ton of websites recently -- but I still wouldn't buy them even at a discounted price. Overall like a 2.5/10.\n\n**Vaporfly 4:** I was initially skeptical about the VF4 after being let down by the VF3, but I\u2019m genuinely impressed!! Nike seems to have finally struck the right balance between comfort and energy return. I\u2019ve only tested them in a few workouts so far (800s, mile repeats, 200s), but the transitions between paces felt smooth, the energy return was strong, and cornering was stable. My biggest takeway is that the shoe is just really solid & well constructed.\n\nWhile Nike markets the VF4 as a shorter distance companion to the AF3, I could absolutely see it performing well over the marathon distance. Dare I say... the Vaporfly is back?\n\nI think Nike got a few things right:\n\n1. \u2060\u2060The VF4 is insanely lightweight yet feels far more stable and structured than the VF3. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it comfortably held up past 100 miles.\n2. \u2060\u2060The continuous rubber under the forefoot makes for secure landings and clean toe-offs. Gives much more \u201csolid\u201d landings than V3.\n3. \u2060\u2060The ribbed mesh upper is light and supportive. Feels like a sock or an extension of my foot and the shoe has a great lockdown and fit. The padding in the heel collar is chef's kiss and makes it sooo comfortable.\n4. \u2060\u2060Soft landings while still maintaining energy return and propulsion.\n\nThe VF4 feels like a return to form for the Vaporfly line. I do think my favourite is still the VF2 because I'm a sucker for a really aggressive shoe, and I haven't been marathon training in a while lol, but I'm looking forward to using my VF4 in upcoming races + workouts. I give this a tentative 7.5/10!",

      "The VF3 gets a lot of hate, but I\u2019ve found it to be the most comfortable super shoe for my foot without sacrificing too much performance. Current 10k and 10 mil PB are in the VF3.",
      "I have run 9 marathons during the last 6 years all of them with Nike's shoes. I used the Nike Vaporfly 4% for the first 2 marathons which was a great shoe and it held up past 400 miles. I stoped using them because during the pandemic I bought the VF 1 and 2 and I used the VF 1 for marathons 3,4 and 5. After that I bought the original AF(now AF 1)and used them only for one (my sixth) marathon. I used VF 2 for the first time in 2023 for my seventh marathon then VF 1 for the next one and finally VF 2 for my last marathon last April. With these shoes I got my marathon time from 3:54 to 2:58.\n\nBTW I also own the VF 3 which I only used for a 19 km workout I think last January and never used them since then.I totally agree about VF 3. It is slightly more cushioned compared to the previous version but lacks bounciness and responsiveness. No idea why they produced such I shoe especially because we're talking about a marathon shoe. Durability is also awful with only one track workout little pieces form the exposed midsole fell off something with never happened not only with the other Nike marathon shoes but with the exception of ASICS metaspeed v.1(which had the exactly same problem) with any other super shoe(I also have marathon super shoes from other brands aside form NIKE and Asics, like ADIDAS,MIZUNO,PUMA,HOKA, NEW BALANCE, UNDER ARMOUR, BROOKS and SAUCONY).\n\nI can not agree about VF 2 though. What you mean with  \"\u00a0lack of comfort and how harsh the shoe can feel\"? As a race shoe it is and must be slightly tight but I wouldn't call it uncomfortable. And my legs were always ok with them(and any other of the aforementioned shoes). I don't think it is possible at least for my legs not to be sore after a marathon but every time I've run one, they were ok after 4 days maximum. After my third marathon(3:04)I developed a problem with my left calf which constantly produced muscle cramps. I changed my training and my fueling a little bit but I think the use of VF 2 for my last 2 marathons are the main reasons for getting rid of my muscle cramps  and running a sub 3 hours marathon for the first time. That is also the reason why I stopped using the AF because I noticed that the low drop made my calf pain worse.\n\nThe VF 1 had 2 problems first of all it destroyed my right big toe(which fell of after a couple of weeks)and strangely the laces got twice undone during one of my last HM last October which has cost me a new HF PB. Those were the reasons for not using them for my last 2 marathons.\n\nI don't have and will not buy the VF 4 so can't comment anything about those shoes, aside from the fact that they obviously lack stack height for a marathon shoe(only 35 mm on the heel) and are more of a 10 k or HM shoe now.\n\nDurability wise I still use the VF 1 with 200 miles the VF 2 with 200 km and the AF with also 200 km. Especially the last one looks as good as new. The VF 2 has a few little cuts on the midsole but nothing serious mostly aesthetic.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jat92ar1ilye1.jpeg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05d5669cc0462cb3a7dfb1f4d7f71b7ad5faf155\n\nThese are my VF 1 ,BTW",

Took it out on tired legs after a 15-mile trail run the day before and a slow 5-mile recovery/warmup run earlier in the day and it had me going at sub-7:00/mile (4:21/km) pace with very low relative effort for most of the 7-mile run.\n\nEnded up at 7:11/mile (4:28/km) pace despite an uphill mile at 8:15/mile (5:07/km) which I struggled through. Been logging 105mpw over the past month (mostly on the trails), so I'm sure I could do better after some rest, which I really look forward to doing.\n\nWeighed in at 5.7oz (162g) for my US men's size 8, which is virtually the same as my Adios 9, tying it as the lightest pair of running shoes I have and 0.3oz (8.5g) lighter than the Sky Paris. The fit is TTS and perfect for me and the upper lockdown and foothold is superb.\n\nThe bounce and propulsion from the forefoot is amazing and seems to fit my gait cycle perfectly in that I didn't need to adjust at all like I've had to do with the AP4, CX1 2.0, and EE2, i.e., finding the sweet spot for the foot strikes. With the FR3, the foot strikes felt just so more natural for my gait. This shoe, like the aforementioned shoes, is definitely best for forefoot strikes. For me, no issue at all with stability and I really like that there is very little volume at the heel.\n\nI had always been interested in the Fast-R 2, but the weight and the look had me hold off until this version and I'm really glad that I did. It's still early and just one run, but I never felt this kind of excitement and performance on my first run, even when I wasn't really trying. Puma knocked it out of the park with this shoe. Now I'll patiently wait for the Metaspeed Ray. Haha. What a time to be a runner."

    "title": "Topo Athletic Aura: First Run",
    "selftext": "Background: I'm a casual runner doing 15-30 miles a week on road and trail. No races, just collecting shoes and miles. 5 foot 6 inches at 155 lbs. I do own these, but I DID NOT pay for these shoes. These were provided to me by my employeer. I did select this model since I wanted a stability shoe for easy runs.\n\nShoe: Topo Athletic Aura mens size 9D. 10.9oz/309g. 38 mm in the heel and 33 mm in the forefoot. This is similar to the neutral Atmos, but this a stability shoe with a denser \"Y\" shaped section under the heel. Similar to the Hoka \"J\" frame. \n\nThe run: 4.3 mile easy road run through the city at 10:40 min/mi avg pace with a few faster sections. My legs are beat up from two trail runs in the past two days. So this was a recovery run all the way.\n\nFit: As usual, Topo comes in the W I D E toebox. I don't need all that space, but it does make for a comfortable fit. At first step in, I noticed the ortholite insert riding up on my arch a little bit. I would prefer a more flat insert, but I didn't notice it during the run. The Aura has a very soft and snug feeling upper. This is probably one of the most comfortable uppers I've tried. No lace bite, no pressure from materials or stitching. This might be too narrow in the midfoot for people with wide feet. Yes the toebox is wide, but the shoe narrows out as it gets closer to the heel.\n\nRide and Cushion: This isn't an exciting or fast shoe and nor should it be for what it's trying to do. My heels would slowly sink into the foam on landing and gently roll forward to toe off. It's hard to describe the softness on landing. It's not squishy like a Glycerin max or Bondi. Those two other shoes have a quick sink in reaction. The Aura is a more subtle softness with little to no bounce. For the way I run, I feel the softness on my heels and then the ride firms up as I transition to my forefoot. This all created a smooth and comfortable easy run for me. I can see this being a great walking or work shoe. If you can get past the looks and current price, I would highly reccomend this if you need a stable shoe for easy runs.\n\nPrevious Shoes: I've have a lot of stability shoes and have run in at least 10 stability shoes from several brands. I would put the Arahi 5 as my least favorite stability everyday trainer and the Guide 16 as one of my favorites. I've found the Glycerin GTS 21 and 22 to be too boring and firm so I passed on those. So far, the Aura is looking to be my favorite stability easy run shoe. The upper fit and ride is the perfect combo for me while providing some stability. I wish the shoe looked better.\n\nPros: Smooth rocker and ride, upper is a big pro on this shoe, toebox for those needing a lot of space up front, not many stability shoes at 5mm, can use for work/everyday use \n\nCons: $165 USD is getting up there and I don't like how all shoes keep getting more expensive, looks aren't great, creasing on the foam after 4 miles, might be too narrow in the midfoot for wide feet.\n\nTldr; Great stable shoe for relaxed easy and recovery runs with a very very soft upper design. Nothing exciting and it isn't a hard clunky support shoe.",

      "I took this for a very quick test run at the Running Expo for london Marathon. I really liked the shoe but i'm too much of a hot head to add this to my rotation alongside the Evo SL. The Aura is the first shoe that has ever fitted nice around my heel and i've tried A LOT of running shoes. The toebox room was also gorgeous and meant i could size down. The running motion felt very natural, unrestricted and allowed my foot to roll nicely from heel off the big toe. It actually felt more neutral compared to my experience of wide platform shoes like the Novablast and Rebel v4. I don't know if i would call it stability, moreso natural support. I just don't know if i'm sold on the EVA mid sole after running in so many exciting foams and rockered shoes.",
      "Good review!\n\nJust got these and found the zip foam to be the softest of all their non peba midsoles.\n\nVery smooth and stable. Makes you forget they\u2019re on your feet and just focus on the run. \n\nOver priced for what they give you but roomy and well built. \n\nThe Saucony Guide 17/18, Vongo 6 and Kayano 30/31 can be had for cheaper and are a better ride for the money."

    "selftext": "About me: \n51F \n4\u201911\u201d (150cm)\n97lbs (44kg)\nRecent 5k 25:22 & Marathon 4:09 (others are really old-my 10k is 1:11 something\u2026) \nHeel strike like a boss (except sprinting)\nCadence: easy runs 170-180, speedwork 215+\n\n\nAbout the shoes:\n5.4oz (153g)\nStack Height 17mm, drop 2mm\nMidsole FuelCell\nOutsole: N Durance\nWomen\u2019s size 7.5W\nStraight up racing flat that is track legal.  \n\n\nThe shoe is available at Joe\u2019s New Balance Outlet, Women\u2019s currently priced at $90, Men\u2019s at $60 & $90 depending on colorway.   I tried to use a black background in the photo to show how much the mango color pops, but it looks a little creepy.  So I took one at the track too.  I\u2019m not very good with pictures.  So go to Joe\u2019s to check out more product pics.  They come in this mango color and the teal/blue \u201cjade\u201d color that the Pacer v2 is in.  \n\n\nI am a pretty small person, and sometimes I want a small, no muss, no fuss, not ginormously stacked shoe to do some old fashioned speedwork.  I am also not a fan of stuffing plates/rods/shanks in everything.  And while I have run in racing flats of old, they didn\u2019t have any fancy foams.  So I thought this might fit the bill for me.  I think I\u2019m still looking for the shoe that the original Supercomp Pacer v1 would have been without the plate.  \n\n\nWith a track workout on the schedule, today was the day to christen the Pvlse v1.  I was intrigued, but also a touch wary because I tried the Altra Escalante Racer to fill this same role, but found I wanted a bit more stack height.  So naturally, I\u2019m now trying a shoe with 5mm less stack. \n\n\nThese fit quite a bit more generously than I was expecting.  The heel and midfoot are a solid lock (no heel lock lacing), the laces are good and a good length, the toebox has a surprising amount of space-both width and height.  I was expecting racer fit, but got daily trainer.  I\u2019m not sure I need the wide.  \n\n\nI live fairly close to the local high school, so my warmup and cooldown are my jog to/from the track (2 miles each way) on a mix of asphalt and concrete.  At slow paces (10:00-ish), heel-striking like a champ, the shoe is firm, but comfortable and responsive.  It\u2019s not bouncy like an Evo SL, it\u2019s responsive in a firm, non plated, lots of ground feel, racing flat kind of way.  I suppose if you were to imagine a Rebel with the midsole compressed to about 1/2 the height, that\u2019s probably close to how these feel.  \n\n\nAt the track, I did some strides and a few short sprints and really liked the feel of the shoes when I was up on my toes.  They were light, snappy, and while the shoe is quite flexible, the front of the sole is stiffer - which gives a pop to toe off but also gives almost a rocker/toe spring feeling.  It was delightful.   I normally do my speedwork in plated shoes.  It was nice to have something flexible and nimble (and not gigantic) on my feet. \n\n\nTonight\u2019s workout was 400\u2019s.  I don\u2019t really enjoy track workouts at all, and I dislike 400\u2019s the most.  I suppose that\u2019s not relevant, but I can\u2019t help but whine about them at every opportunity.  I generally run my 400\u2019s at 1:50-1:55 and that was consistent tonight even without a plate or a huge pile of super foam.  With so much ground feel and so little shoe, I was really able to play with turnover and stride in ways that I\u2019m usually not able to.   I really enjoyed the shoes tonight.  The 400\u2019s?  Not so much.  \n\n\nFor some final thoughts\u2026I am roughly the size of a 9 year old and I would not wear these for anything longer than a mile or two on the road.  The track surface is soft enough to give enough cushion (for me) for something longer, although I\u2019m not sure what I would run on a track that is much longer than 2 miles.   I was fine with my easy jogs to and from the track, but I think they just not have enough cushion for me to be comfortable much longer than that.  But I also wasn\u2019t running in race form on the road (where I\u2019d have less ground contact time, higher cadence, etc.).  \n\n\nIt was bone dry, so I have no idea how grip will be in wet conditions.  It was rock solid on dry surfaces.  \n\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a modern racing flat that is crazy light, fits well, and feels great (and is legal height) on the track, take a gander at the New Balance Pvlse v1.  If you\u2019re taller/heavier than I am, you may not find these palatable because the stack height is extremely low.  The FuelCell helps with the feel of that low stack, but it\u2019s still very low and you do feel at one with the road.  \n\n\nThis is my first review ever.  Please don\u2019t yell at me.  \n\n",

    "title": "Brooks Catamount Agil: First Run",
    "selftext": "**Background**: I'm a casual runner. 5 foot 6 inches at 155 lbs. I do own these, but I DID NOT pay for these shoes. These were provided to me by my employeer. \n\n**Shoe**: Brooks Catamount Agil (say Uhgeeel with a French accent) mens size 9 (unisex sizing) 7.7oz / 218g. DNA Falsh v2 foam; same as Catamount, Hyperion 2, Hyperion Max 2. pebax plates. 4.5mm lugs. 16mm in the heel and 10mm in the forefoot. \n\nRun: 5.4 miles, 509 ft of elevation, avg pace of 10:39 min/mi with some 6:45 min/mi - 8 min/mile paces thrown in. I ran in a city park with hard packed damp trails, several water puddles, wooden stairs, 1 minute of sloppy mud, and sidewalk for the final 400m.\n\n**Upper**: Very thin, breathable, and secure. This is a very lightweight and comfy fit. The stretchy sock like material around the heel is a nice comfortable addition. I had no issues with the laces or fit loosening up after running. Water would get in and clear out the shoe very easily. My feet got wet even when running through wet 2-3 inch grass. 2-3 steps through wet grass and I could feel the water on my feet. \n\n**PLASTIC OVERLAYS** \\- I've tried on two pairs in store and felt/heard a popping noise while walking. This was caused from the overlays creasing when the shoe is bent while walking. The noise was annoying, but I still went with the shoe and was lucky to get a pair delivered that didn't have the popping creasing issue. IF I did have the popping noise, it would not be a dealbreaker for me. \n\n**Ride and Cushion:** This is a firm, stiff, and responsive lower the ground shoe. The lightweight design, foam, and plates make this shoe pop and make it easy to go fast on all surfaces. The lugs are long enough for me to not feel most rocks and roots I ran over. I felt very nimble in this shoe, and I was able to cut sharp turns on the trails. This was the only time I have felt like a trail running or cross country athlete. My run ended with about 400 meters on the street and I sprinted to the finish. Even though my legs were cooked from a challenging trail run the day before, I still wanted to send it in these shoes. My feet felt great after an hour run and I will try then again for a 2 hour trail run. I did feel some shin splint pain which I get from time to time in very neutral shoes. So I might need to take it easy with these shoes. \n\n**Traction**: Again, I was in a low technical park with damp dirt and hard surfaces. It was very impressed even when slowly running through a 50-foot section of 1/2 inch watery mud. I felt confident enough to take these on more technical trails (same as my X-Bionic run). \n\n**Pros**: Looks, lugs depth, responsive pop, lightweight, fast.\n\n**Cons**: No weather protection and firmness. *\\*Durability/Longevity\\** Time will tell: how long this foam low stack foam lasts before its dead, how long will the very thin upper hold up, and how long the exposed plates will last before they break. \n\n**Tldr**; It's a very fun and agile lightweight racing shoe for shorter distances. The design sacrifices cushion, ankle support, and weather protection for speed. \n\n**How will I use this shoe:** This instantly became one of my favorite shoe within a few minutes of running. I'm willing to try these for steep technical trails as long as temps aren't cold. I hope these can work out with the amount of overpronation I have. So I will have to keep running in them to see if they cause shin splint pain on every run.\n\nFor about $120 USD on US amazon, I would recommend these if you are looking for a 2nd or 3rd trail shoe. It's a great price point if you have a fast 13-15 mile race coming up.",

    "selftext": "**Background**: I'm a casual runner. 5 foot 6 inches at 155 lbs. I DID NOT pay for these shoes. These were sent to a store I work at. I have limited experience with trail shoes.\n\n**Shoe**: X Bionic Terraskin x00/C (without the included socks) with carbon plate and vibram outsole. US mens size 10. I typically wear a 9 for road and trail. This size 10 worked well, but a 9.5 might be better.\n\nRun: 9.5 miles, 2500 ft of vert on dry to damp moderate technical terrain with a small stretch on sidewalk.\n\n**Upper**: very comfy and a secure locked in feeling even though the shoe is a full size bigger. No tightness or lace bite. I laced them am hour before the run and has no issues with the shoe loosening up during the run.\n\n**Ride and cushion:** The midsole didn't feel all that energetic, but had a small amount of response. The shoe felt like it was a curved shape which helped with landing to toe off transition. It didn't feel very flat like a Brooks cascadia.  I got the feeling of the lugs digging into soft dirt, especially on uphill climbing. The grip and traction were very good on gravel, roots, rocks, and damp soil. The shape and design of the foam gave a stable and structured ride.\n\nI have tried on a lot of trail shoes in a store so take this with a huge grain of salt. The foam on this reminded me of Nnormal shoes, but with a wider last. A little dull, a small amount of rebound, not completely flat, not exciting.\n\nOn flat trails, it was okay at picking up speed. Fast for me is in the 8-9 min/mile range. Overall, I was happy and fairly confident with the shoe's performance on my ascent. On the descent is where I felt the shoe start to open up. I had two small slips on loose bark and had an ankle roll/collapse that luckily didn't result in injury, which is typical for me. I had to keep myself from going too fast on steep sections. Once I found gradual downhills, I was able to hit some fast paces. The shape of the shoe with the plate seem to favor quick downhill running. This made it more fun than a cascadia, divide, or terradventure.\n\n**Pros**: stability, looks, lock down, grip, downhill running\n\n**Cons**: possibly too bulky and heavy for some races or fast runner. PRICE.\n\n**Tldr**; Good looking shoe with very good traction. A bit heavy and ridged, but it can pick up the pace on level ground or downhill. It's very difficult to justify the $300 for casual running.",

    "title": "Brooks Hyperion Max 3 First Run",
    "selftext": "Background: 5'6, 130lbs\n17:03 5k, 35:51 10k\n\nWith the 3rd iteration of the Hyperion Max 3, Brooks has made the shoe a truly max shoe. 45mm in the heel and 37mm in the forefoot, and a top stack of DNA gold. Took it out for a 10km easy run at 4:45/km and in my opinion, it feels way better than the Hyperion Max 2 at easier paces. I liked the Hyperion Max 2 for speedier efforts (under 4:00/km) but didn't like it as much when using it for what I would typically wear a daily trainer for. The addition of DNA gold has softened it up enough that it is enjoyable at easy paces for me. The shoe feels very bouncy, and I had trouble keeping the run slow. Will take the shoe for some faster efforts and see how it feels at threshold and faster, but will most likely use it for easy mileage and long runs. No problems with grip so far, but I'll see once I get a run in the rain. The upper is slightly better than the already amazing upper from the Max 2. The back portion of the upper is a knit material that kind of reminds me of an upper on ultraboosts, and  covering it on the front portion of the shoe is a tougher but still soft mesh that is very breatheable. There isn't too much padding in the heel which I appreciate, they added a tab on the heel making it easier to put on, and the tongue is gusseted again. One thing that I really dislike about the shoe is the choice to change the laces. I loved the notched laces on the Hyperion Max 2, and for some reason they changed them to just regular laces. I just don't like how they had something that was good, and decided to remove it. \n\nOverall, I quite enjoyed the shoe for my first run, and I feel like I'll enjoy them even more once they soften up after a few more runs.",

Aside from that, the fit was great; the wide toebox at the forefoot gave enough room for toe splay. While the Pebax foam gave the shoe a firm feel, it was not much of a problem for me due to my weight and my preference for firmer foams. The rocker geometry took some time to get used to as this was my first shoe with such features. During my first two runs with this shoe, I noticed the prominent arch support dig into my heel a bit which caused the meaty part of my right foot (below the bony medial malleolus on the inside) to be swollen after the run. Thankfully this was temporary and went away the next day. I did not experience this pain on the next two runs; at this point (\\~30km) I noticed that the foam had broken in and molded to the shape of my feet, which made the fit even more comfortable.\n\nAt faster efforts, the propulsion due to the rocker and the Pebax foam reminds me of Endorphin Speed 2 and 3, the foam reminds me a lot of Saucony\u2019s Pwrrun PB. The slightly higher stack height (37mm at heel, 32mm at forefoot) makes this shoe protective for longer runs. When I took this shoe for a 19km progressive run I did not experience any foot discomfort, even after accounting for foot swelling. I took this shoe out for a variety of paces from 200m intervals at 3:30/km to 5km threshold/tempo efforts anywhere from 4:15-4:40/km. The intervals felt mushy and required me to put more work into them while the longer tempo efforts felt more effortless. \n\nI plan to use these for longer efforts (\\~20km+) with pace work thrown in during my upcoming marathon training block to test the shoe\u2019s full capabilities. So far it\u2019s looking quite promising. This is easily a great tempo shoe addition to any rotation. \n\nWorth buying?: \n\nYes, if you have wide feet. Trying this shoe on in-store is strongly encouraged before buying especially since the wide toebox can challenge those with narrower feet. Keep in mind that this shoe also does not have a plate. I purposely wanted to rely less on plated shoes which is I bought the Specter 2. If you want something more snappy and responsive, there are many other options out there (Hyperion Max 2 is a good shoutout).",

      "Also on the main NB website. Excluded from any other discounts, of course. NB is by far the most stingy with their coupon codes out of all major brands. (Veteran, healthcare, teacher discount, etc.",
      "Damn I'd been wanting to try these but still getting so much use out of my novablast 5s",
      "These were at the outlets last week with a buy 1 get 1 50% off if anyone has a NB outlet by them"

    "title": "NORVAN LD4 - initial thought compared to PEREGRINE 13 and LD3",
    "selftext": "Hello,  \nLast year, I bought a pair of Arc'teryx Norvan LD3 as a \"do-it-all\" shoe for running, trail running, and hiking while traveling \u2014 something versatile enough to be worn casually as well.  \nI love their aesthetics, and the full VIBRAM Litebase outsole is fantastic.  \nAt the time, I was looking for a replacement for my ageing Peregrine 13s, which had racked up around 550 km (341 miles). I really enjoyed the Peregrines, especially in muddy conditions where the lug design gave me great confidence on downhills.  \nHowever, they had three major drawbacks:\n\n* After about 3 hours, they became tiring on the feet. The mesh rock plate under the forefoot becomes quite noticeable on rough, faster sections, especially as the cushioning starts to fade during longer runs.\n* The aggressive lug design demands a lot of focus on uneven terrain at higher speeds. If you're fatigued and your stride loses some vertical lift, it\u2019s easy to catch a rock with your foot and risk a twisted ankle or a fall (though this might partly be due to my running form).\n* The outsole is very slippery on rocks \u2014 I really wish Saucony would use Vibram rubber on the Peregrines.\n\nAs I was training for a 50 km race this spring/summer, I didn\u2019t want to rely on my worn Peregrines. I decided to take a chance on the new Norvan LD4, mainly because they have similar stack heights and a VIBRAM outsole.\n\nLong story short: the LD4 is very close to what I always wished the Peregrine could be.\n\n\\------------------------------------------\n\nFirst impressions: they are noticeably firmer than the Norvan LD3 \u2014 you can tell as soon as you step into them.  \nFor context, I tend to prefer firmer, more precise shoes for trail running (shoes like the Kiprun/Evadict XT7 or the Evadict/Kiprun Race Ultra). That's why I didn\u2019t switch from the Peregrine to the LD3 \u2014 I didn\u2019t find the LD3 stable enough on technical descents for my stride.\n\nThe LD4 is firm, but not harsh. It protects you from sharp rocks while still offering excellent ground feedback, much like the Peregrine did.  \nImportantly, the cushioning is consistent: during a recent 4-hour training run, the foam didn\u2019t break down like it did with the Peregrine. As proof, I set a PR on a steep downhill near the end of the run (after 3h30 of running).\n\nOverall, the ride feels \"old school\" \u2014 don\u2019t expect the bouncy, highly dynamic sensation you get with modern superfoams. But it\u2019s lively enough for faster, flatter sections and remains reliable throughout longer runs.\n\nThe outsole features 4 mm lugs with a broad pattern, offering a smoother ride over uneven terrain \u2014 better even than the Peregrines \u2014 and good grip on rocky descents.\n\nAs for fit, it works well for me. The toebox feels slightly wider than the LD3\u2019s, but I haven\u2019t experienced any blisters or discomfort so far.\n\nToe protection is excellent. There\u2019s a sturdy membrane up front that takes up a fair amount of space, offering much better protection than the Peregrines.\n\nFinally, on looks: it\u2019s subjective, but I find them quite stylish. The orange color is very bright out of the box \u2014 almost like high-visibility hunting gear \u2014 but the intensity fades quickly. After a few days of brushing them clean, the color has already noticeably softened.\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\nThere are some drawbacks, though:\n\n* Traction and grip in deep mud felt better with the Peregrines \u2014 they really shine in those conditions, in my opinion.\n   * Lockdown can be hit or miss, and I experienced some toe banging on very steep downhills. That said, it\u2019s mostly on me \u2014 I should have probably sized down by half (taking a 41 1/3 instead of a 42).\n   * The knitted tongue tends to slip when putting the shoe on, so it needs to be properly adjusted before starting a run.\n   * I use the second set of eyelets for a runner's knot, but the laces are just barely long enough to make it work. With time and experience, I figured out the best way to lace them up, but overall, the lacing experience was better with the Norvan LD3.\n\nIn the end, I really love the Norvan LD4. They\u2019re very close to what would be my \"ideal Peregrine.\"  \nThey perform great on uphills, are enjoyable on technical terrain, and are smooth enough for easier trails.  \nWhile they might not be the best choice for extremely muddy conditions, they\u2019re precise and offer a lot of ground feedback.  \nI believe they\u2019re ideal for races up to around 70 km (50 miles). However, for distances of 100 km (62 miles) or more, you would probably want something with a bit more cushioning.\n\n  \n\\-------------------------------\n\nI'm 32, 177cm/5'10\n\nDistance ran with the shoes :\n\n92km/57 miles, 5 867m / 19 252 ft of elevation gain\n\nI encounter nearly every terrain possible :\n\n* From dirt, leafy trails, light mud, rocky trails to hard iced snow\n* From hills to steep pass\n\nThe only exception will be heavy mud.",

      "Always loved the look of Arc'teryx\u00a0trail shoes, but they just seem way too 'old school' as you say to justify their price tag. They are basically 2010's Salomons. They're owned by the same brand as Salomon, so kind of surprised they don't seem to be innovating as much, even though I also don't usually care for Salomon trail shoes.",
      "Great review! Almost have purchased a pair myself at several different times.\n\nDespite the world of running trending towards bouncy super foams, sometimes it feels genuinely great to run in a shoe with a snappy and firm platform. Especially so on trails where the ground provides a bit of natural cushioning.",

      "When can I expect the endorphin speed 4 or Metasky Paris to go on sale?",
      "So I just started getting into running and read through the wiki. I looked on RunRepeat and see that many of the shoes on there are labeled as both \"daily trainer\" and \"tempo\".\n\n  \nCurrently I'm using the Brooks Launch GTS 9, which they label as daily running and tempo.\n\n  \nIf I'm running mainly only 5K, and possibly 10K in the future, if I wanted to build a lineup, how would I differentiate between the two options of \"daily\" vs. \"tempo\" when so many of the shoes are labeled as for both? Would I get two pairs and use one for daily, while the other is only used for tempo?",
      "I bought some Craft Endurance 2\u2019s because they were on steep sale and, at least on paper, seem like they should be pretty high-end shoes (full pebax foam). $90 for otherwise $180 shoes.\nThe foam was as advertised - responsive, light, etc. and I had no gripes there. However I\u2019ve never had a shoe with such abysmal foot lockdown. The upper felt like a trash bag with how much space there was. My foot was sliding forward, backward, etc. because there was literally no lockdown. One online shoe reviewer (maybe from BITR) basically said that he wouldn\u2019t take corners in this shoe for fear of breaking his ankles and I second that statement.\n\nTLDR the Craft Endurance is a good upper away from being a good shoe, but as it stands, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to anyone. I returned it yesterday.",
      "Hey there! Maybe not a shoe question but still gonna ask: Today (Friday) was supposed to be my last easy run before the half marathon on Sunday (target time: 1:59:59). Unfortunately, the runner\u2019s high hit me with the nice weather, and I ended up doing a few hill sprints\u2014probably pushing close to 100% of my max effort (kind of forgot about the half marathon on Sunday\u2026). And now I can definitely feel my calves and thighs quite a bit.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the best thing I can do tomorrow to help my body recover from today in time for Sunday? Should I just move from the couch to the fridge/toilet and back? Drink 3 liters of chocolate milk for recovery? Or would a relaxed walk be better for recovery? I need ideas! \ud83d\ude48\n\nHow much have I messed up my chances of doing well on Sunday?",

    "title": "Asics S4+ Yogiri: Thoughts as a runner with mild stability needs",
    "selftext": "The availability of stability-friendly supershoes is more or less zero. The S4+ could be a remarkable shoe for those with *certain* milder stability needs *and* dreams of running fast for longer. So, after writing that I probably wouldn\u2019t do another shoe review after my Pegasus Plus review last summer, I\u2019m back at the keyboard after my long run, because this shoe has some fantastic design elements, and a few areas of attention that those with mild stability needs may want to know about.  \n  \n*Fit:* The S4+ Yogiri fit my size US 9.5 / EU 43.5 normal to slightly narrow feet with higher instep **true to size** together with my other Asics and Adidas models. The sizing is between regular trainer sizing and tight-fitting racer sizing. The toe box is wider than some racers I\u2019ve used, but not decidedly wide for my feet; I could tell both sides of my forefoot were stretching the upper just a bit. The heel counter is quite stiff, and those with sensitivity to stiff, thin heel counters may want to try on and run on treadmill before purchasing, and the extra fabric along the achilles tendon is appreciated.  \n\u00a0  \n*Forefoot:* The rocker on the S4+ Yogiri is in my view kind of a masterclass in rockers. While the rocker itself is well-placed and smooth, the guidance provided through the lateral and medial shaping in the forefoot rocker is worth its own little segment. The rocker begins like the On Cloudsurfer Next, with a rocker that begins earlier on the lateral forefoot, resulting in a guided lateral motion when rolling forwards. Rolling onward, the rocker\u2019s direction reverses very well to medial motion at toe-off. It's not the first shoe I've run in with forefoot guidance but this mild first-lateral-then-medial guidance provides great, natural-feeling forefoot guidance at any pace I ran, from 5:30/km to 3:30/km.\n\n*Midfoot:* The midfoot fit and midsole coverage remains narrow, despite having a few millimeters added from the Metaspeed. Moreover, it has an interesting design element with a large amount of lateral material support, and less medial support. You can see this visually from a top-down view.\n\n*Heel:* For those with heel guidance needs, the heel narrowness of the Yogiri may not suit them well. This guidance need was one of the reasons I inadvertently became a midfoot striker loading on the forefoot over time. The midsole design at the heel can inadvertently encourage medial *or* lateral collapse due to the shaping between the FlyteFoam and Turbo+-sections in the posterior sides. For me, with some medial heel guidance needs back there, that means walking and running at slower paces where my heel begins experiencing load, my ankles start feeling it. Luckily, guidance remains good with midfoot and forefoot strikes at intended paces.\n\n*Ankle collar:* In a market with with appears to have an increasing amount of running shoes with checkmark-shaped ankle collars as opposed to more symmetrical/oval collars *(see: checkmark collars on* ***Nike Ultrafly*** *and* ***Pegasus 41*** *versus oval collars* ***Asics GT-2000 13*** *and* ***Adidas Supernova Rise 2,*** Asics tends to design shoes with low, more symmetrical ankle collars that clear my low ankles, that otherwise rub and hurt on checkmark-shaped collars. The S4+ Yogiri continues Asics\u2019 trend in this area for which I\u2019m thankful.\n\n*Laces:* They\u2019re nice! Ribbed laces have a nice balance between being able to tie and untie, and staying where I left them when tying. Lace length is normal to slightly short, but still allow for a heel lock with my higher instep. Good stuff.\n\n*Outsole:* ASICSGRIP is nice and sticky on normal terrain, and I did moderatelys harp turns with little issue \u2013 at least none to do with outsole grip. I have not tried them in wet conditions.  \n  \nAsics' name stands for a latin sentence translating to \u201dsound mind in a sound body.\u201d It seems fitting then that Asics would be the first to design a superfoam plated shoe that didn't stress me or my mechanics out on the run. Happy to reply to any questions I can somewhat decently answer.\n\n\u00a0",

    "title": "Brooks Glycerin Max -- Review after 400+ miles",
    "selftext": "I've been wearing the Brooks Glycerin Max as part of my regular rotation since November and I\u2019m genuinely impressed! About me -- 5'4\", \\~120 lbs size 8.5 in women's, primarily using these for long and easy runs, usually between 7:45\u20139:00 per mile (4:50-5:35/km). I usually buy a size 9 in women's running shoes, but I bought my normal shoe size in these. Other shoes in my rotation include the ASICS Metaspeed Edge, Nike Pegasus, On Cloudmonster, and as of recent the Nike VF4.\n\nI originally picked up the Glycerin Max looking for a \"supertrainer\" with a similar feel to the Superblast (the SB 2s gave me the worst shin splints of my life lol). I'd never tried anything from Brooks before, but admittedly these are really pretty shoes so I was intrigued. Brooks marketed the Glycerin Max as a Superblast competitor: something you could use for everything, including workouts.\n\nSpoiler Alert: These aren't really \"supertrainers\" and they aren't particularly fast, but they ended up filling a need I didn\u2019t even realize I had. They\u2019re awesome recovery day shoes: super high stack, soft, slightly heavy, and they create a smooth, almost rocking sensation with every step. While they wouldn\u2019t be my first choice for a tempo or hard workout, I\u2019ve been able to do strides and hill sprints in them without a problem. They\u2019re versatile enough to go a little faster, but they don\u2019t have the same \"bounce\" or energy return like most super trainers. Personally, I don\u2019t mind the lack of bounce because I use carbons for most of my speed workouts, and for easy days and long runs, I prefer something softer and less springy. The high stack on these really helps my legs feel fresh even after several hours of running. I'm prone to calf and shin issues, but I've had no flare ups or foot problems with these shoes and the high stack height makes my legs look so long and nice lol.\n\nAt $200, the price is steep, ngl, but I've gotten a lot of use out of them. I stopped tracking exact mileage (whoops), but it\u2019s somewhere between 450\u2013550 running miles and lots of walking miles. My current pair still has a little life left, but I just picked up a second pair since I'm super cautious after my past shin issues.\n\n100% recommend if you're looking for a decently versatile shoe that helps minimize impact and is incredibly protective without being too sluggish. The rocking sensation is really nice as it feels like a gentle nudge forward while you're logging the miles :) I'll add pics of my shoes -- they don't have a lot of wear on the bottom surprisingly, but it's mostly the foam which I can now feel is starting to wear.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eb7fdesqq7xe1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=572400f6780c686e4eb7d16ab406f4beb6be1718\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2bav5dsqq7xe1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e1dd052ea6fc0b42f8ea0706b9b69f4d1d319bc\n\n",

      "I love how everyone\u2019s perspective of shoes is different, I purchased these and going to return them. I don\u2019t like the rocking sensation and they are firm to me, not as cushioned or soft as I thought they would, be based on others reviews that swayed me to purchase them. They are also bulky making my small foot, size 6, look crazy haha. But all in they didn\u2019t work for me, glad you like them.",
      "Nice write up! As a heavier runner I thought the foam and rocker in these were great for easy runs. Could go in them all day. Really didn't care for the huge thick upper though.",
      "I really like the rocker on them, but I find them pretty firm for recovery shoes, and too heavy for long run shoes. \n\nI also feel kind of banged up the next day after them, but that could also be that I usually wear them after a hard week anyways. \n\nGood, not great\u2026 slightly overrated.",
      "I wanted to love them because I really like the stack and how it\u2019s tuned but they gave me a blister on the arch of my left foot after 8k. A lot of ppl seem to have the same issue in the exact same spot so definitely something wrong with the left shoe."

      "I had a long conversation with the Saucony rep at the London Marathon expo.  He had worked for them for 6 years and was involved in development. \n\nHe said that their focus is on the road and lifestyle categories as the sales are so much more. \n\nI explained how I came to the brand from the OG Endorphin Speed and Pro and have had every iteration up to the 3 but most of my time is spent in the Exodus Ultra line 1 & 2 (2nd version upper disintegrated) and Endorphin Edge and the Speed. For me the Endorphin line and Exodus most recent iterations had got a lot more narrow and I asked had the lasts of the shoes changed across the road and trail ranges and he said no but the uppers had each time to support development. He also told me that the Endorphin Edge 2 was prototyped but Saucony did not see a long term market for carbon plated trail shoe and the Edge has been discontinued. \n\nI explained having spent many years and a small fortune on the brand I have come to love I had to look elsewhere for my road and trail as the fit is just too narrow for me now.  \n\nThey guy was super nice and thanked me for my feedback and said he would pass it on. \n\nAnyhow enough of my ramblings, maybe interesting for some.

      "The Superblast 2 was my first ever Asics shoe and after about 400km of wear is my favourite shoe of all time.\u00a0",
      "Recently got the magic speed 4, love them for my tempo and my 5k/10k/HM races, only thing i don\u2019t like is that i couldn\u2019t get them in the yellow and red colour way",
      "Considering getting the Superblast 2 for long run workouts that include marathon pace progressing to tempo as well as tempo work outs. Would these be a good option? For background, my goal marathon pace is 5:59 and tempo pace would be 5:25-5:30.",
      "Using the novablast 5 as my daily, I don't like the feel as much as the 4. But I don't have any real complaints, it does what I need for an easy day shoe. \n\nMagic speed 4 for longer intervals/tempo work. Just got this recently and I like it fine, I wouldn't race in it and consider it just a good plated budget workout shoe that doesn't feel or respond like a premium racer. I stick with my takumi for shorter intervals and shorter races.",
      "It appears asics is possibly going to announce their new \u201chyper shoe\u201d with FFLeap foam. I don\u2019t believe we will see the mew Metaspeed Tokyo\u2019s until close to fall so this will likely be just the MZ Type-1. \n\nAdditionally, if you want to see other trademarked names they\u2019re going to use on upcoming products, see [this](https://www.ipqwery.com/ipowner/en/owner/ip/100559-asics-corp.html). \n\nI\u2019m curious if the \u201castroplate\u201d is the tpu plate going to be used in the upcoming sonicblast or the new plate design for their hyper shoe. I guess we\u2019ll find out."

      "Was not my intention, but I\u2019ve slowly become a Brooks fanboy. Tempo shoe is Hyperion Max 2. I also just bought the Glycerine 22 GTS and my legs and feet feel like they\u2019re in heaven.  It\u2019s a moderate stability shoe for sure but that\u2019s what I need",
      "Hyperion Max 2 is my favorite shoe in years and it\u2019s not even close. Kind of concerned that the stack on the 3 is going to be too much for my ankles. I have no idea why they decided to turn it into a super trainer, but I guess everyone is trying to go the Superblast route.",
      "Long Timer wearer of Adrenaline GTS and will have to say the 24 is a nice improvement from 23 (which I enjoyed). Happy Brooks brought back their stretchy shoe laces, hated the previous versions that used the non-stretch laces. Color choice wise I wish Brooks would start to offer more colorful options like they do with Ghost, Glycerin and Hyperion. Most color choices are some version of Black or White and few are ever as fun and colorful as they use to be or offer in other styles.",
      "Stores around me have the new Ghost 17 in stock, and I tried a few pair on yesterday. Brooks lowered the drop to 10mm, which is nice. I take a wide, and I was very happy with the fit. One surprise was that I actually had to go *down* a half size to get the fit right, especially in length. At my normal size (8.5) the length was a good 1.75-2 thumbs from toe to tip of shoe. When I went down to a half size, everything seemed to snap into place and the fit was right on. Nice comfortable shoe with a reasonably sized stack (I\u2019m not a big stack fan, myself.)",
      "I can only hope that when Brooks ultimately releases the ghost max 3, that it is more like the original version and less like the version 2"

      "Have now done one track session and a 5k road race in the Streakfly 2 and thought I\u2019d share my first impressions. First time posting a review here so please let me know if something is missing and I\u2019ll be happy to update. \n\nAbout me: M39, 176 cm, 66 kg. Normal size US 10.5, a bit wider than average feet with high arches. Mid/forefoot strike. \n\nThe Streakfly 2 are TTS for me, width is more on the narrow side. Overall I\u2019d say the fit is a nice and snug race fit and I had no problem getting a good lockdown. Tongue is non-gusseted and I\u2019ve had to fiddle a bit when tying the shoes to keep it flat. \n\nMy first run in the them was a track session with 800 repeats at 5k pace 9 days ago. Initial impression was that the shoes were super light on foot (135g in my size) and felt like a very cushioned spike. As conditions were cold and extremely windy, and I was quite fatigued as well before the session, I couldn\u2019t say too much about the performance of the shoes. \n\nYesterday I ran a 5k road race in them on a flat course (10m difference between highest and lowest point), but with a number of sharp turns. Temperature was perfect for racing at 9-10c and sunny, but unfortunately quite windy. Was front running from start to finish and finished in 15.19. \n\nThe Streakfly 2 definitely feels much more like a track spike for the road than it feels like a super shoe. It\u2019s super responsive, but not bouncy, and while the official specs say it\u2019s a 4 mm drop, the geometry of the shoe makes it a negative drop in reality. This makes it quite aggressive and it has a more traditional, non-rockered ride. While it has a full length carbon plate, the plate is not as stiff as in a super shoe. That is probably a good thing considering the geometry of the shoe as a stiffer plate would make them even more aggressive. Roads were dry so can\u2019t say too much about the grip other than that they felt very secure on those sharp turns. Too early to say anything about the durability.\n\nOverall, I must say that I\u2019m really positive about the Streakfly 2 so far and that it\u2019s great for its intended purpose (to go fast over shorter distances). While they feel more similar to a track spike, they are a lot easier on the legs and more protective than I expected. I would actually say that my calves haven\u2019t felt any different after these two runs than after similar efforts in the Takumi Sen 8/9 or Adios Pro 4 that I\u2019m also currently using. This could probably be different for someone who is not used to wearing track spikes or is more of a natural heel striker. \n\nGoing forward I\u2019ll for sure be using them for road races up to 5k and I think they\u2019d also work well for me for a road 10k, but it\u2019s still too early to say if they would be my first choice for that. I also expect to use them for a lot of track sessions when not wearing spikes and they would be my first choice for a track 10k (as I\u2019m not sure I could manage a 10k in spikes). I want to use them a bit more and at some different paces before making my final conclusions, but so far they are everything I wanted them to be.",
      "Have there been any rumors / leaks about the Pegasus 42? I know there won't be any drastic changes given they updated the midsole last year, but June is coming up quickly and I haven't seen anything yet.",
      "The Winflo 11 is perfect for my longer runs, which for me is about 7 miles. The Pegasus Plus is perfect for when I'm doing tempo or pushing it on a 5k.\n\nPersonally, the Winflo 11 is a real winner and much better than the Peg 41, which i wear casually. The EVA and Air Zoom combo mirrors the Peg 36, but just with a higher stack height. An amazing affordable shoe to soak up miles.\n\nI hate plates, so the peg plus is essentially my racing flat. I love it for that.",
      "If Pegasus premium weren't so expensive, would it be a decent shoe overall?",
      "Nike Terra Kiger 10 is out, I've run 32 miles in them so far.  Big update, dropped a lot of weight.  I actually stopped paying attention to the TK model a few versions ago when they started getting so bloated.  This one is kind of getting back to what they used to be.  Going to be a very popular shoe for Nike."

    "title": "Altra Experience Flow 2 - First 20 Miles",
    "selftext": "Somehow got my hands on a pair of these early via Road Runner Sports (shows Sold Out now). Background, I had 2 pair of the Experience Flow and really liked them. Not an Altra wearer previously, but the low drop, rocker and light weight on these worked for me as a daily trainer, and I put 300+ miles on each pair before relegating them to walking shoes. Just a very reliable and stable daily trainer for me.\n\n**First Impressions of the Flow 2:**\n\n* Have done 4-5 runs now, about 35 miles total. After the first 15 miles or so, the shoe started to break in and the upper in particular felt better. Feels, to me, a little thicker than V1.\n* I had 2 main gripes with V1 - slippy heel and fine-but-not-amazing EVA foam. They seem to have addressed both of these with a new heel counter with better lockdown and a new (I think?) foam.\n* They also changed the laces (I like these less), gusseted the tongue (fine, but wasn't an issue for me), and made the tongue slightly longer and slightly more padded. These are a wash, for me.\n* Unrelated - I think Altra could be much more popular if they hired a new design team. These shoes are so plain, and some of their colorways are straight up fugly. Most look like shoes for semi-retired urology clinic assistants.\n* Back to this shoe - the new foam really pops, and works for me. Has nice bounce and is less firm than the EGO Max foam, which I felt was pretty firm. This shoe has a nice rebound without being too squishy.\n* This is Altra's \"medium fit\" AFAIK, and it fits me well, if not a little tighter than V1 because of the upper changes. I suspect they'll break in a bit more after 50+ miles with some foam compression.\n\nIt's early, but this feels like a solid upgrade.\n\nIf you like the V1, I wouldn't \\*rush\\* to get these, as I feel like the V1s will soon be on sale for \\~$100 and represent a good value at that price point. If the forgettable foam was your only gripe with V1, you'll really appreciate these.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/105l5pbqbuwe1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=417c015230b76023d51b91c5bd0a6000870cb0aa",

Some say it's the Chinese version of the alphafly, some Chinese elite have gone sub 2:10 in these. I have the OG alphafly so I guess I can compare it abit. Foam is just slightly firmer than the alphafly, but only did 10k so it might soften up to be similar to the af1. Rocker isn't too aggressive, more to a bouncy ans explosive toe off rather than quick heel to toe roll transition. All in all good value, would consider these for my next race, or the bmai jingtan fly which I also feel is similar to the af1 (bouncy, easy rocker, soft, calf still fresh after run).",

    "selftext": "42M, 180lb, heel-striker, recreational runner typical run is 1hr at 7:30 to 8:20 min/mile, 10 years running experience. Rotation - Ride 17 (Daily), ES2 (Speed), Endorphin Edge (Trail).\n\nGoal for Shoe -  Easy/ recovery /long run to the rotation, ideally with better wet traction than all the Sauconys.\n\nOthers Considered - Vomero 18, Hurricane 24. Knew the AG3 was the one though before I got to the end of the first block on a test run at local running store.\n\nFirst Run - 3.6 miles. Planned a 5K, started at an 8:20 pace that felt absolutely effortless - so effortless I thought I had only run 2 miles when I had already done 3. Some reviewers mentioned clunky transitions heel to midfoot but I didn\u2019t experience at all. Light on feet, great bounce but controlled, stable, just right level of softness. Kicked it up to 6:30 min/mile pace and the foam came alive - so bouncy and fun, incredible energy return. 5/5\n\nLook - it looks like a shoe. 3/3\n\nFit - TTS in size 11. First shoe I didn\u2019t need to runners knot to get good heel lock down (seriously, in 10 years). Good midfoot lockdown, toe box roomy but not overly so.   Note - my left foot is barely wide but 0.5 size shorter than right which is almost narrow. 5/5\n\nUpper - super comfortable step in. Breathable. Plush, as they say. Saucony-level quality except that the top of the tongue is a little wide and can take a half second extra effort to get in place when tying. 4/5\n\nBuild Quality. 5/5\n\nMidsole - \ud83d\udd25. Light, bouncy, energetic, soft - all at Goldilocks levels. What I think everyone hoped the Triumph 22 would be. The max cushion shoe for EVO SL lovers. TPU so should be highly durable. 6/5\n\nOutsole - Good coverage and thickness. Good dry grip. Exposed outsole is recessed. Good thickness. Tried the GRVL version for extra rubber but that outsole was too stiff, whereas road version has good flexibility. Hopeful for good wet grip but roads were dry today. 5/5\n\nFirst Run Overall Impression - Platonic ideal of a shoe for easy / recovery / long. While I haven\u2019t laced up a pair of Superblast 2, I believe the reviewers who like the AG3 better. ES2s are more fun with their need for speed; AG3 is the most pleasant shoe I\u2019ve ever run in, and I\u2019d buy any shoe Salomon puts on this midsole. Looking forward to throwing a few more types of runs at it. 5/5",

    "selftext": "M 6ft2 85kg HM 1:24 Mar 2:58 Midfoot striker \n\nHey all, crossed over 200km mark on the NB 5 so thought would give my thoughts. \n\nHow I\u2019ve used the shoe: \nCurrently training for a 100km road ultra so putting in some decent long runs at various paces and this has been my go to shoe for that. Some examples or runs I\u2019ve done. 42km at 4:30 (all paces in min per kilometre), 60km at 4:45 and a 40km and 5:10. \n\nFit: went tts and had no issues. Feet on the slight narrow side but have plenty of room in the shoes so imagine wider feet would be fine. \n\nUpper: fairly light weight and breathable and overall very comfortable. Two points on the upper, 1) the heel has a lot of padding so can\u2019t see any rubbing issues there. 2) the tongue is the only potential issue I have with the upper. It\u2019s pretty thin so can get a little bit of lace bite if tighten to hard. Obviously I guess an area to save weight but think a slightly thicker tongue would be welcome. \n\nMidsole: overall have really enjoyed the ride of the shoe. It\u2019s got a very soft feeling when walking or standing in it but find it firmed up a bit on the actual run so had no issues with stability or foot fatigue while on the longer runs. I have seen a few comments on how it\u2019s overly soft for a long run shoe but haven\u2019t found that. Maybe at my weight I compress it enough to mitigate that but maybe something to consider if you on the lighter side. At this point it\u2019s pretty much a max stack shoe but found it didn\u2019t feel that big on the foot but certainly feel the amount of cushion that\u2019s there. \nI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s not overlay bouncy or has a lot of energy return to it but has a nice solid consistent ride that gives you just enough back for those longer effort. I also had no issues with it bottoming out or loosing its pop while on the longe runs. \nWhen trying on in store I found it quiet a similar ride to the brooks glycerin (but was only on a 5 minute test so cannot comment on long term feel). \nOne thing I do notice is it feels like there is quite a prominent heel on the shoe if you sensitive to that (no where near the Triumph feel but is more noticeable than I thought). Didn\u2019t bother me at all but I think heel strikers could work well with the shoes. \n\nDurability: so far so good and no issues here. One thing I\u2019ll say is the foam doesn\u2019t seem that great at decompressing. So find if you use the shoes over a few consecutive days you do notice it gets noticeable harder each day. But if you give it a day or two between uses find it works well then. Have seen a few comments about the durability issues (in terms of the mid sole life) \n\nSummary: think it\u2019s a very solid shoe. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll blow anyone away but as a daily trainer or long run shoe think it\u2019s a super solid option. \n\nHappy to answer any questions \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n\n\n",

      "I'm over 200 miles in my pair and they went from being good for the 1st 100km to just being a bit meh nothing special for the rest of my runs, maybe I need to let them rest like others have said,  use them for easy runs only around 5 - 5.30 km pace.\n\nCurrently unsure what my next easy day shoe will be.\n\nThanks for taking the time to do a review \ud83d\udc4d",
      "Having two of them in a rotation right now feeling good putting them on nearly daily.\n\nI think the most important part to keep them in a good shape is to give the foam some rest each time you run them around 24-48hrs (thats why I have now two pairs)\n\nGot 180 Km in my first pair in and they still great but less bouncy",
      "Same feelings. Very okay shoe. A softer SB2 with less of a rocker. I love my EVO SL but would love them to have more grip for a mixed used between roads and trail",
      "These are my first pair of Novablasts.  Agree they need a day/two for the foam to refresh back.  Overall happy with them, but man they are loud and slippery on wet pavement."

      "I have been really getting into running over the past couple of years. I'm not fast by any means, but I did my first marathon last fall in 4:35 and I'm wondering if a super shoe might be fun to try out for my next marathon cycle. I've mostly just run exclusively in Altra shoes. 2 pairs of Escalante 2.5's for two half marathon training cycles, then 2 pairs of Escalante 3's and Escalante Racer for the race (after putting \\~60 miles on them on various training runs to break them in and be sure there were no issues). Now I'm alternating 2 pairs of Escalante 4's, which will probably need to be replaced soon, and I'm wondering what I should try for a race shoe. I'd plan on doing at least 2 long runs, 2 tempo runs, 2 interval days, and 4 easy runs in them. Does anyone have recommendations on what I might have the most probability of success with coming from zero drop Altra's? Should I stick with Altra and try the Vanish Carbon 2's, or go all out with something like the Nike Alphafly 3?",

    "selftext": "* **Shoe Model & Size: Puma Fast R-3 size 10**\n* **Fit/Comfort Notes: True to size, snug midfoot, open toebox**\n* **Use Case: Workouts, Road Racing (I can probably do 5k+)**\n* **Distance Ran: First pair: 93 miles**\n* **Reason For Buying: Provided for us for the Project 3 Program**\n* **Personal Observations: see below**\n* **Comparisons: propels you forward like a vaporfly 2, soft enough to not be as unforgiving as that shoe.**\n\nBackground:  \nI've been a massive shoe nerd since HS and collected a ton of spikes (\\~50 plus pairs of racing flats/track spikes (basically everything from the jasari to the Mamba 2 and the original zoom streak until the lunarspider). I've been wearing supershoes since the 4% back in early 2019. Below are the shoes I've worked out in/raced in over the last couple of years.\n\nNike: Vaporfly 4% (Flyknit), Vaporfly Next Percent, Vaporfly 2, Vaporfly 3, Alphafly 3, Dragonfly, Streakfly 2  \nAdidas: Adios Pro 3  \nSaucony: Endorphin Pro 1  \nMizuno: Wave Rebellion 2  \nOn: Cloud Boom Echo 3, Cloud Strike, Cloud Strike Light Spray  \nBrooks: Hyperion 2  \nHoka: Carbon X, Carbon X2, Rocket X, Rocket X 2, CieloX1, Cielo X2  \nNew Balance: Rebel Elite V4\n\nI ran all of my personal bests on the road in the Vaporfly 2 (24:27 8k, 67:29 half, 2:19:13 full). I enjoyed how firm they were in the forefoot and the shoe design worked really well with my form. As the Vaporfly 2 was phased out for the new models, I gave them a shot. My coach (eatrunswag) really liked the V3 but I just couldn't get a good rhythm in that shoe. My thought was that I had been running with that plate structure for years at that point that the change in design made it hard for me to adjust (obviously a sample size one 1 here lol.) I sold my pair to a buddy. I stocked up on a couple pairs of the two and they ended up being my shoe for the remainder of 2023 including my personal best at CIM.\n\nI've spent much of the last year looking for a replacement to the Vaporfly 2. While I've run my personal bests in them, the shoe is pretty unforgiving. If you're battling any sort of aches and pains this shoe tends to put you in a hole. Both my 50k attempts had me hurting on my feet by 15 miles and a rough ride for the remaining 16.\n\nThe Cloud Strike has been my go to prior to the program. I have a combined 500 miles over two shoes in these and was one of the lucky few to buy a pair of Light Sprays New York City Marathon Weekend. These were 1A/1B as replacements for CIM 2024. The former: Bouncy and a pebax insole in the forefoot that made for a forgiving landing even in long mileage. The latter: A true extension on the foot where the lightspray still has plenty of lockdown and the ride is a bit firmer than the Cloud Strike.  \nRaced NYC Half and Project 13.1 in LS, Detroit Half in Strike. Enjoyed them both a ton.\n\nThe final try for me was going to be the Asics MetaSpeed but I never got the chance to try a pair.\n\nI applied for Project 3 in Feb and didn't think I'd get an email back. My PR is from CIM and Boston is historically a bit slower than that. 3 minutes off a 2:19 PR as a 32 year old doesn't give much confidence. But I was accepted and after some chats with coach (particularly on the foam composites), I was in.\n\nWorkouts/Performance:  \nI took them out for a spin during my LR workout first week of March. 3x3 miles with w/1 mile float recovery. Goal: 5:30-5:25:20  \nActual:  \n5:29-31-27  \n5:23-24-21  \n5:14-19-13  \nI'd been banged up a bit for a lot of this training block so I had no idea how my body would react to these. They were extremely light but strangely soft. I originally worried on my jog out that this would fall a bit flat when I wanted to get really aggressive with them but it almost felt like each stride was negligible. I had to keep myself in control because I was going much faster than I was prescribed. The loop features pretty sharp turns and a combination of short incline and declines and the shoe was able to respond well across all of it. I think we've all had issues taking sharp turns in supershoes and this has been the easiest I've been able to do it without feeling my foot is going to turn over.\n\nI've taken them out on the track for multiple of sessions varying from K repeats to a 22 mile LR with uptempo miles at the end. The shoe could perform across a wide variety of distances. Got down to 2:25 at the end of 800m repeats and they worked like a charm. I had an 18 mile run in a rain storm with 15min @ 5:40-45, 15 @ 5:20-25, 15 @ 5:15-20 in the middle and the I didn't have any noticeable slippage from lack of grip on the outsole or from the upper on our bike path. Upper clears the water incredibly easy too so it doesn't feel like a squishy drag with water pouring.\n\nOverall Thoughts:  \nMy first impressions with these were that it felt like wearing supershoes for the first time. I laughed as I ran uptempo in these as every stride felt fairly effortless. My athlete is also in Project 3 and I had to warn her to keep an eye on her paces as these shoes tend to have you running faster than you think you're going. It hits that sweet spot of not too firm and not too plush. I'm able to recover off long sessions without too much general soreness and my calves don't feel thrashed. They're soft but I don't feel like I'm fighting the shoe like I do with the airpockets in the Alphafly. There's not an extreme rocker shape to this like Rebellion 2 or the early iterations of the hoka shoes had. Despite the gap between the forefoot and heel, I don't feel like this shoe is unstable. I've take turns harder than needed in training to really weartest them and I don't feel like it impacts the integrity of the shoe. One of my issues with the Vaporfly 2 was the forefoot felt like my foot was a little bit out of control late in races, almost feeling like my foot was turning in on itself. This forefoot feels spacious and stable, even with longer miles. I've had issues with sensitivity on the top of my foot (had horror stories about the Adios pro) and I don't feel pressure and sensitivity on it. Durability so far has been great so far. Interesting to see how long I can regulate my first pair to workouts.\n\nOne of the questions I asked when they first did the original presentation on it was if there was a variation of performance/fit based on footstrike/preference/stride pattern. They claimed that it was testing well across a variety of different running styles. I was blown away off the gun but I was confirmed in my thoughts that they truly hit a home run when coach also responded the same way.\n\nI've worn a lot of supershoes and just in general race shoes over my almost 19 years in the sport. This is the best shoe I've ever worn. Regardless of how Boston goes tomorrow, I'm planning on running in these for CIM this December. Happy to try to answer any questions as well before I head to bed.",

    "selftext": "**Shoe model and size: Norda 005 - size 12.5** \\- 1/2 size up from my normal TTS and the same as my Norda 001 (as recommended)\n\nDid my first 10 mile run with the Norda 005's this morning and was not very impressed. I was fatigued from a faster road long run yesterday, but honestly, I thought that this would be perfect for a shoe that was designed to go long.\n\n**Distance ran: 10 miles**\n\n**Initial impression** is exactly opposite all the entirely positive reviews that I've read.\n\n**Fit:** Upper is baggy - way bigger and volumous than the 001's (which I'm a fan of) I had to crank the laces down on my smaller foot until the sides were almost touching. Lots of movement and overall sloppyness in the shoe - It felt a lot like the Craft CTM ultra which got across the board critisim due to a big upper.\n\n**Use case:** Gravel and mildly technical MTB / single track -\n\n**Reason for buying:** Potential shoe for my first 100 mile race (Jevelina 100)\n\n**Personal observations:**\n\nThe midsole was meh I was surprised about this - Maybe my legs are so shot from a 16 mile day yesterday but I don't think thats it - Every single review that ive read/ watched people are literally ranting about TPEE. Felt really soft, like a Clifton with 200 miles on it. I truly think this is the reason why companies opt plates in shoes (even trail shoes) - to stabilize an otherwise very mushy foam. I have a discounted pair of Nike Ultraflys that feel like a dream on this same 10 mile loop - Again a shoe that was across the board slammed for heel slip issues.\n\nAbout the heel slip, its worse for me than the 001's The new dyneema seems to give more than what was used on the 001's I adjusted fit 3 times during this run, which is a major red flag for a distance shoe. Again, every reviewer mentions slip in the 001 and then assures that the 005 is different - It's built on the same last and has no collar around the Achilles so... yeah.\n\nI really wish that reviewers would say right off the bat if the shoe is wide. Like Altra wide. Anyone with a lower volume foot would swim in this shoe - Length was fine.\n\nBreathability was good - I had doubts here as the weave is very dense - It was 80 by the end of the run and the shoes were still dry while I was soaked in sweat\n\nDurability seems good - maybe better than reviews have stated. There's a lot of rough gravel on this loop and I've had shoes show visible tread wear with just 8-10 miles - Lugs look good. I completly ate it, catching a rock underfoot and there's no scratching or abrasion anywhere.\n\n**Comparisons:**\n\n**Norda 001** \\- Mor\u0119 secure fit, more stable, responsive ride. Way less movement underfoot. Less breathable. Maybe less lively than the 005 - I never really opened up with the 005 due to fit - with the 001 I bomb downhills without really paying attention to my feet.\n\n**Craft Pure Trail** \\- Really similar upper fit feel - lots of movement in both shoes. Craft has a more responsive, stable midsole. Terrible ousole on the Craft. Something about how hard I had to lockdown this shoe always caused some sort of issue on longer efforts. While the 005 fit is sloppy it isnt uncomfortable even with everything cranked down to the max.\n\n**Normal Tomir 2.0** \\- More secure upper after break in of about 150 miles. Midsole was very firm in comparison but seems to be more forgiving as I keep running in them (have 250 miles on this pair now). Midsole is sorta brickish on the Tomir - 005 feels more nimble and less tank-like\n\n**Nike Ultrafly** \\- Honeslty I got sucked into bad hype on this shoe. I truly enjoy running this shoe and experience some heel slippage on uphills due to the stiff plate. Very balanced midsole with the plate and zoomx foam. Great lace lockdown for downhilling. The 005 feels more attached to the foot without a place, but much softer.\n\nDoes anyone else have any experience? I'm gonna take em out for one more run later this week and then most likely sell them. I thought for sure this would be my 100-mile shoe due to experience with the 001 but I barely made it through 10 miles this morning.",

      "I was also underwhelmed during and after the first run of 13 miles in the 005, especially considering all the hype that had been building up since last year before the recent launch. I liked the lightness but the fit of the upper was a bit baggy going half-size up as Norda recommends, the midsole didn't feel as amazing as advertised, and the outsole's grip wasn't as confidence-inspiring as, say, on the 001, VJ Ultra 3, Prodigio Pro, or the Nnormal Kjerag or Tomir 2.0.\n\nWell, I've now logged around 50 miles in the 005 and I absolutely love it. This \"super\" midsole has come alive and the outsole can handle whatever I throw at it. I need to wear thicker socks and cinch down quite a bit to get a secure lockdown, but I don't get lace bite and it feels quite comfortable now. I'm interested in trying it in my normal TTS size because I still have plenty of room in front of the toes.\n\nI'm not saying that you should give the 005 50 miles to see if it will work out for you. If you don't feel it and don't think it's going to get better, you may as well move on. At first, the 005 felt like a lightweight road trainer in the vein of Rebel v4 or the Evo SL that had been adapted to trails, but those shoes are less than half the price of the 005. It felt good to run in something so light on the trails, but everything else felt kind of meh and I couldn't understand what the hype and the rave reviews were about.\n\nI took the 005 on a second run of around 15 miles with about 3,000ft of elevation again through all types of terrains and I started feeling the midsole getting more propulsive and responsive. I checked my watch and I was moving noticeably faster than the perceived effort, which is a hallmark of supershoes. I bombed the downhills which I wasn't so confident about doing on my first run like I would with the VJ Ultra 3 and the Prodigio Pro. The 005 was just as protective and stable while being more agile and nimble. The outsole grip which I wasn't so sure about felt a lot more secure. I was like, \"Hmmm... I guess it's coming alive now for me to get what the hype is all about.\"\n\nAfter the third run of another 15 miles a few days ago, I was sold and grinning from ear-to-ear afterwards. It's light, fast and propulsive, responsive, stable, nimble, grippy, comfortable, and protective. It pretty much does it all in a very lightweight package. I haven't gone on a run over 15 miles, so I can't say how it will hold up over ultra distances, but I do plan a 50km run soon and a 90km race in the summer. My inclination is to stick with the Tecton X 3 for such distances, but I'm rotating the 005, VJ Ultra 3, and Prodigio Pro right now to see if one will come out on top. \n\nThey are all great shoes, but the 005 being almost 1.5oz lighter than the TX3, U3, and Prodigio Pro does give it an advantage. I'd like to get to at least 100 miles and a 50k run in each before coming to a conclusion.",
      "I have about 30 miles on my 005s and absolutely love them. I was previously in the Hoka Mafate speed 4. While these are lower stack and less cushion, there is no sacrifice in comfort. Love the soft underfoot feel and responsive ride, love how nimble and lightweight they are which gives me a lot of confidence on the trails. Additionally , no heel slippage for me, maybe the best lockdown on any shoe I've ever had.",
      "My local running shoe store strongly suggested Prodigo Pro over Norda 005 for narrow feet. I find the 001 to have too much volume without an extra insole, I was told to not even bother with 005.",

    "selftext": "Adidas Adios 9 first impressions\n\nAbout Me: I\u2019m a 145 lb 6\u20191 ft high school XC and Track runner that usually gets 30-35 miles a week in. \n\nCurrent Rotation: Brooks Glycerin Max for easy days, Hoka MachX2 for long and aerobic runs, Metaspeed Sky Paris for tempo and faster. \n\nTodays Run: I took this out for 4 miles today on roads, 2 mile warmup, light set of 4x400s at 2 miles pace since I have a meet on Tuesday, and a mile cooldown. \n\nHow They Felt: They felt pretty nice on the warmup, I really could feel the lower stack in these compared to my Glycerin Maxes so that took some getting used to. After the first mile I really started to enjoy these, I would describe them as being nimble, natural, snappy (but not overly so), and fun. They really do feel like natural extensions of your feet, which I haven\u2019t had before in racing flats I\u2019ve used like the Takumi Sen 10 and the Adios 8 (more on the uppers later). On the 400s they worked great, I love how easy it is to corner and turn in these compared to my metaspeeds. I could definitely feel the lack of any speed assistance, just my feet working and the decently soft Lightstrike pro underneath. \n\nFit: The shoe fit nicely, despite me going a half size down since I dont know European sizes that well when I ordered this colorway from a European site. There\u2019s a thumbs width in the forefoot and I can wiggle my foot around, so decently roomy. I think half size down was the right choice for me. The Lightlock upper on this is fabulous, it has a very secure heel fit which Adidas has struggled with in the past that really hurt my enjoyment of shoes like the TS10 and Adios 8.  No problems with anything else\n\nOutsole: No complaints, gripped decently well on the puddles I ran through. I appreciate the full rubber coverage. \n\nHow I Plan to use this: I got this for XC since I do most of my workouts on a XC course (and the Lightning McQueen colorway is \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25) that has all the characteristics of one, like gravel, roots, plenty of hills, and uneven terrain. The purpose of this shoe is to take over workouts on the XC course so I don\u2019t tear up my metaspeeds there. Hopefully these will perform better than my TS10s and Adios9s there, those always came untied and I had lots of heel slippage.\n",

The Boost midsole delivers soft, responsive cushioning that really helps reduce impact, especially during longer runs.\n\u2022\tStability: While not a traditional stability shoe, it offers surprisingly good support for overpronation.

The outsole grip is great for treadmill use, with minimal wear.\n\u2022\tPros: Superb comfort, stylish design, great for flat feet and daily distance\n\u2022\tCons: Slightly on the heavier side compared to other running shoes, not ideal for speedwork or tempo runs\n\nUltraboost 5X leans more toward plush comfort than structured stability\u2014but they\u2019ve exceeded my expectations in handling overpronation. They\u2019re also more versatile for casual wear thanks to the sleek design.\n\n- First Run (1\u20132 Runs):\n\u2022\tImmediate step-in comfort with a soft, sock-like fit\n\u2022\tBoost cushioning felt responsive and absorbed impact well\n\u2022\tNo break-in needed\u2014no hotspots or discomfort out of the box\n\n- Initial Thoughts (<30 Miles):\n\u2022\tExcellent comfort for treadmill runs; noticeably reduced strain on arches and knees\n\u2022\tPrimeknit upper stays breathable and adapts to foot shape nicely\n\u2022\tSlightly heavy, which affects pace during faster intervals\n\n- Review (30+ Miles / 48km):\n\u2022\tConsistently plush ride with reliable cushioning over longer runs\n\u2022\tDurable outsole with minimal wear, even after daily treadmill use\n\u2022\tGreat option for overpronators despite being a neutral shoe\u2014solid heel support and wide base help with stability\n\u2022\tNot ideal for tempo or speed sessions due to weight, but perfect for easy and recovery runs",

    "selftext": "I love these shoes so much! They\u2019re now my first choice to wear but I know I have to avoid relying too much on plated shoes but these were just perfectly made for me.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hajcyeuzltve1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b4d01e4f12f38ecb3b1734cd70ea27dc19077bf\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/31nuleuzltve1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e16f839024edb9fbdff952ea02ee630edec9fee\n\n# Fast facts\n\n* User profile: M, 180cm, 70kg\n* Shoe size: 28.5cm in all brands\n* Average weekly mileage: 60-80km\n* Running style: neutral; fore and mid-foot striker\n* Run used: daily runs (\\~5:30-6:00/km); long runs (\\~5:00-5:45/km); tempo runs (\\~4:20-3:50/km)\n* Terrain ran: dry and wet road (concrete, asphalt, cobblestone), muddy light trails\n\n# Thoughts\n\nSome of these will be brief repetitions of what I said in my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1hzo7k0/puma_deviate_nitro_3/) unless stated otherwise.\n\n# Size and fit\n\nMy feet are 28.5cm which corresponds to PUMA\u2019s EU44 size. The forefoot tapers a bit but it wasn\u2019t a problem with me since it is still roomy even after my feet starts to swell after 90 minutes/16 kms of running or more.\n\nI find PUMAs to be narrow so please take note of this fact if you are sensitive to these details.\n\n# Ride\n\nAfter 500km, it is still very comfortable and encourages higher cadence on faster paces.\n\nI hate shoes that \u201cfeel flat\u201d like the Adidas Adizero SL v1 and Asics Noosa Tri 15. For some reason, these feel like those two on first try but for some reason these transform into lively quick trainers that can last up to half-marathon distances!\n\nThe narrow forefoot is felt *sometimes* but as I mentioned before it is still roomy for me and I can just adjust a bit to move my foot strike a bit on the midsole. This never resulted into discomfort or even slight tingles of pain after some time.\n\nI never needed a runner\u2019s knot because when I tried it, my forefoot was too squashed to the tip and it wasn\u2019t comfortable.\n\n# Performance\n\nOne of my confusions about these shoes is that I never felt the obvious responsiveness or bounciness some claim these have due to the plate. I am used to the plushness of Asics Novablasts and Superblasts which I can definitely say that I felt their responsiveness and bounciness especially at faster paces. But for some reason, these shoes are fast and they perform well! They have wonderfully and consistently \u201cdisappeared\u201d from my feet during long runs.\n\nOther commenters have told me already in the previous post that the PUMA Deviate Nitro Elite 3s have that \u201cobvious\u201d padding with responsiveness and bounciness that I was looking for. I will look out for discounts once the DNE4s are released and maybe the DN4s will have the current technology of the DNE3 hopefully.\n\nFor a proper use case, I was able to test them today in a 5km self-race as part of my Pfitz training plan. I was supposed to use my Asics Magic Speeds but it was raining so I chose the DN3s as precaution from possible slipping. These were actually only for long runs but they surprised me today! They performed as good as the MS in the sense that I didn\u2019t feel that I needed to exert more energy compared to the other. Of course I felt the difference in terms of padding between the two but that didn\u2019t matter when I was focusing on finishing. I got a new PR of 20:34 with these and I am proud of that!\n\nThe PUMA grip is real. These carried me through winter reliably and I only slipped once because of hard ice which is understandable to be a hard limit. It has been dry in the past four weeks and I like them the best now for some tricky twists in some paths. I confidently know that I won\u2019t slip and slide because of turns. I am all praises for this technology.\n\n# Durability\n\nThe upper is still pristine and intact as the day I opened the box. I recently tried the PUMA Magmax and found them to have a stretchy upper similar to Nike\u2019s Flyknit technology that I loved. I wish the DNEs had a stretchier upper because sometimes I can feel the slight rigidness on hotter days but again, not a complaint and didn\u2019t affect the comfort while running.\n\nThe forefoot has definitely flattened a bit after so many long runs but only visually! It is still as reliable from day one in my experience. Same with the midsole/plate with tons of dents from rocks and rough surfaces but overall I didn\u2019t feel a degradation in performance yet.\n\nLastly the rubber grips just look slightly used and don\u2019t show any sign of wear and tear yet!\n\nI truly believe people\u2019s claim that I can take these up to 1000km and I\u2019m excited for that.\n\n# Overall\n\nI am a satisfied customer and now a PUMA grip believer! The harshness of winter solidified my trust and confidence with these and the warm, sunny spring unveiled more exciting features of the DN3s.\n\nThank you to everyone in this sub who kept on saying that these are underrated and mentioned the key phrase \u201clasts up to 1000kms\u201d which caught my attention.\n\n# Next steps\n\nAs I\u2019ve said before, I want to observe them up to a limit of 1000km. I will be extra nit-picky around the 700-800km mark for any signs of midsole and plate degradation because I don\u2019t see myself using these as daily and recovery trainers because I have the Asics Novablast 3s for that purpose with their plushiness. \n\nOn the other hand, I am wishing they still perform \u201cthe same\u201d up to 1000km because that would be so cool! It\u2019s like I found my favourite shoes of all time that checks all my needs: longevity, grip, comfort and fore/midfoot-friendly.\n\nI will make sure to post a final review of these shoes later in the year.",

Maybe slightly snug but I reckoned that I could always sell them on ebay for 150 at home. In the second store I got the Edge in 47 (30), because the shop attendant told me that it's the right size for me after checking where my big toe lies in the toebox, according to official Asics guidelines.\n\nI ran a PB in the half with the Edge, that one felt great throughout, no complaints. I've been using the sky in a LR workout out though today and it felt really good as well. I expected some pain on outside of my foot because of swelling but it was only slightly (probably starting to hurt).\n\nI previously ran 2 marathons in the NB SC Elite, size 46,5 (interesstingly enough it says 30 JP on the tag) and had considerable on the outside of my foot after the marathon (not in training).\n\nIs it possible that the toebox of the Sky is just wider, or does the foot swelling get worse after 35k? I'll probably do a shorter workout in the Edge during the taper anway and decide then, but I'd really appreciate some opinions."

My long runs are up to 33kms (1.5 hours as a mid week LR to up to 3 hours on the weekend). My long run pace is around 5:30-5:40 min/km average, with MP efforts of 5:15 min/km. I\u2019m 58kg and more of a cadence runner.\n\nWould love some suggestions but otherwise happy to stick with the Trainer again. Other shoes I wear are the NB Elite V4 for workouts and HMs and the recently the ASICS S4+ Yogiri has been added as my Marathon shoe (untested over this distance yet, but felt great for 33km). My daily trainer is the Hoka Mach 6. Happy with all of these.",

      "I\u2019m thinking about getting a pair of rebel v4s. I\u2019ve read a fair few reviews and I\u2019m pretty sure they will suit me well. However, I\u2019ve been struggling to find info on their durability. Does anyone know how they feel after 500-600km? I\u2019ve had 2 pairs of novablast 4s that felt great in the first 300km but lost their bounce and weren\u2019t fun to run in after around 400km.",
      "I have 420 kms on my 860v13s and they're holding up great all around (M, 77kg). I have mildly fallen arches so I mix them in for shorter runs but they are bricks for anything about 14-15 km. As a stability shoe, they're fairly heavy but it just makes my Speeds seem that much lighter for tempo work. I do find the upper is a bit much and not that breathable."

      "I ran in the Vomero 18s today for the first time and I have to say I love them for easy runs/recovery. They are very stable, very cushioned and fit true to size. \n\nI\u2019ve historical been a Nike Pegasus guy. I\u2019ve worn them since high school/college. This year I gained chronic right sesamoid pain getting back into running and the standard Pegasus 41s weren\u2019t cutting it. I upgrade to the Pegasus Plus and they were slightly better, but still not what I needed. I branched out and tried a pair of Novablast 5s and man, did those hurt my feet and feel unstable (sold them after 5 miles). I also tried Hola Skyward X but they were too tight for my feet and weren\u2019t available in wides. I then tried a pair of Pegasus Premiums, which were nice, but still not enough (I sold those too with 0 miles because I decided not to even bother running in them). After today\u2019s run, the sesmoid pain was significantly less then with the Pegasus Plus.\n\nI\u2019m going to bench the Pegasus Plus and use the Vomero 18 for any future easy/recovery/long run. Interested to see how much better the Vomero Plus is vs the Vomero 18. I have a pair of ZF5 and ZF6s for interval training (I love the ZF5s) and VF3 and AF3 for racing. Looking forward to picking up a pair of the VF4s when stock becomes available.",
      "Took the VF4s out today for the first time and Nike has significantly improved over the VF3.  I think I still prefer the AF3, but the VF4 is snappy and light and quite enjoyable to run in. \n\nI did get a small hotspot in my left inner arch, I have the same problem there with the AF3s. Just Nike things.",
      "I\u2019m in total agreement with you! The ZF6 and Vomero 18 are my non-racing rotation and I am super happy with them. Peg Plus is pretty meh and I tried on the Peg Premium at Nike Boston today, didn\u2019t like the feel of them at all.",
      "I purchased a pair of Vomero 18s... Everything felt great but then an hour into wearing them around the house I noticed it was causing pain in my arches. \n\nDoes that mean I have flat arches?",

    "selftext": "Uploaded from my classroom on my prep period! Note- I still have the paper inside the toebox right now because these are fresh out of box. It would normally be more transparent throughout the front.\n\n**Background:**\u00a0I applied to the Puma Project3 program in February, not necessarily having high hopes. While my PR may be pretty quick, I was honest in my application that a PR was way out of reach as I had hip surgery in June to correct an FAI/labrum tear and that my goal was to have a good time in Boston and would love to have a support community race weekend. As I posted yesterday, when I was accepted I texted my coach to make sure Puma made an acceptable road racer. He's a sports scientist at the Olympic Training Center and knows running shoes among the best in the world. He said he'd tested the Deviate Nitro Elite 3s to be on par with a Vaporfly. I asked the program director if I could have a pair of those and if it would be ok if I raced in those if I didn't like the prototype and was told sure, so I signed up.\n\n**Workouts:**\u00a0Did my first workout in them on March 13th. A 20x1'/1' session on a mix of a 2k road loop and track. Was IMMEDIATELY in love. My January-Feb workouts had been done mostly in Asics Metaspeed Sky+ and Vaporfly 3s. Then used them for all of my workouts through last week's session of 10x(2min @ 5:45-50, 2min @ 5:25-30, 2min @ 5:00-5:10). This completed 4 weeks of doing my workouts in them (generally one Wednesday fartlek/interval session, one long run session). From 5k to marathon pace, I was able to lock in and cruise without sore calf muscles after.\n\n**Performance:**\u00a0These are my favorite supershoes EVER. Personally, I've always been a fan of the flyknit 4% and the Next% as my all timers, but these move into number one. They are not as overly squishy as the VF3, which is my one complaint about that shoe. I feel the VF3 is a good shoe but maybe TOO squishy, and sounds like the VF4 they took away all squish to make it aggressive and hard? This feels like a hybrid of the Metaspeed (bouncy but a soft ride) plus a similar propulsion to the Next%, that feeling that you are actually bouncing\u00a0*forward*\u00a0instead of up. I have done one easy run in them, about 70 miles into the shoe, because I left my trainers (Novablast) in my room and I didn't want to sneak back upstairs and wake the kids. They felt totally comfortable at 7:00/mi pace. I just wouldn't use them as trainers because I imagine they're not going to be cheap. Some other shoes, like the alphafly in particular, I'd never do a normal run in because at non-race pace they tend to stress out my plantar.\n\n**Cons**: If anything, I'm not sure these would be my go to for a road 5-10k. I think they would be fine, but if I was going for something really really fast, I'd want something more aggressive. I'd likely run 5-10k in the Deviate Nitro Elite 3 or Vaporfly. Also, I usually wear thin \"racing\"/performance socks when I workout in these to keep them from being too tight. I wouldn't call them super narrow, but as a top performance shoe, they don't waste any space. I'd put the upper fit on par with the VF3. Also, the tongue is not attached to the lacing (non-gussetted I believe is the term?). I haven't had issues with it moving around, but I know this is important to some people.\n\n**Release:**\u00a0I was told that for now, they will only be available in Boston on race weekend at the Puma \"High Point\" at 745 Boylston. The limited global drop is April 25. I don't know how limited it will be. Best of luck, I'd definitely snag a pair.\n\nI'm happy to answer questions later, my students are about to stream back in!",

Honestly the DNE3 wasn't in my options until I watched and read reviews from Yowana, Kofuzi, and also some reviews here in the sub. And holy cow this thing is a nice shoe. \n\nGot it in EU39 (wmns 8.5, and yes another pair of a wmns size) which is one size down from my TTS EU40, but fit is nice and snug in midfoot to forefoot. Used it for some easy 5K run (5:30-5:40/km-ish) and some strides. Wow, the midsole has so much bounce and so much pop.\n\nPros: Amazing upper, great lockdown in the midfoot, very bouncy and a great poppy midsole (definitely wants to go fast as I felt it demanded more from my legs during the easy 5K), grip is phenomenal, vey light weight, great breathability and structure from the upper, and the colorway is a love at first sight for me. \n\nCons: Did a runner's knot to secure my heel as it was kind of loose at the back, this could be too narrow for some as it has a bit of an aggressive pointy toe box, might be too unstable for some people that has pronation issues.\n\nIt is a great shoe and made my turnovers so easy because of the very light weight. Did not go wrong choosing this shoe.\n\nTL;DR: Didn\u2019t plan on getting the DNE3 until I read good revies on it\u2014ended up loving it: super light, insanely bouncy, great lockdown and grip, with only minor cons like a loose heel (fixed with runner\u2019s knot), narrow toebox, and potential instability for pronators.

The results were impressive, with the Fast-R3 posting an efficiency gain of at least 3.5% over the Nike and Adidas by virtue of measuring runners metabolic rate in each shoe. Hoogkamer also tested the shoe with 15 different athletes and in every one, the Fast-R 3 was the most efficient.\n\nThe big update here is that the Fast-R 3 has lost nearly 80 grams versus the 2, a huge difference.

      "I'm planning on posting some pictures to this board tomorrow since I've been training in the shoes since early March. I'm not allowed to do that until tomorrow, but I think I can share some in-shoe feedback.\n\nFor reference, my marathon PR is 2:16:01 and I have run in every version of the Vaporfly including the OG. I've run in the Adios Pro 2 and 3, the Metaspeed Sky +, and the Alphafly 1, 2, and 3. I applied to the Project3 program in February and when I was accepted, I reached out to my coach to confirm the Puma shoes were good before I hit accept. My coach, Geoff Burns, one of the world's foremost running shoe experts, works at the Olympic Training Center and is one of the authors on the paper recommending a limit to the stack height of shoes. He told me he's tested the Deviate Nitro Elite 3 to basically be dead even in testing with the Vaporfly 3, so at the very least I wouldn't be wearing a shoe any \"worse\" than I have been as long as they didn't mess up this new one. I even asked if they could send me the Deviate Nitro Elite 3 to race in just in case I didn't like the new shoe. I take my running very seriously, I'm not one to drink Kool-Aid and run in a pair of inferior shoes just for some free stuff. I have multiple super shoes and years of free gear. I was in the same presentation where Wouter gave us this data, and even I was skeptical..\n\n  \nAll that is to say I had reservations but was open to trying something new and wearing the Deviate or going back to my Metaspeeds or VF if they sucked. That won't be necessary. They are by FAR the best supershoes I have ever worn. I have two other friends in the program who are sub 2:20 marathoners and we texted each other saying our first workout in them felt just like the first time we stepped into super shoes years ago. We hadn't felt that feeling since. These are legit. I'm not being paid anything to say this, my free shoes cuts off after marathon Monday and I will be buying these when my fresh pair wears out!!",

    "title": "Tempus my love : review and comparison between v1 and v2",
    "selftext": "This post is to tell you about the best shoes I've ever tried: the Saucony Tempus! It all started a little over a year ago. Having overpronation issues and not being fully satisfied with the pairs I had at the time (the Saucony Guide 15, too firm for runs over 10 km, and the Hoka Challenger 7, not enough support and a sole that squishes), I started looking for new shoes that could support my high arches and I came across this Sub, which praised the Tempus in many posts.\n\nA little put off by the price at first, I finally took the plunge during a sale, convinced by the various reviews I read, especially since they were advertised as having high arches, perfect for me. The first races were \"meh,\" but after 30km, the shoes broke in and were much more enjoyable to run in. From then on, I've used them for absolutely everything, from 5km to marathons, including (less technical) trail runs, and for all paces; these shoes are incredibly versatile!\n\nStrong points:\n\n\\-very stable, my arch is well supported and my foot is guided naturally;\n\n\\-dynamic, I've achieved my best times in these shoes;\n\n\\-grip, the outsole isn't as bad as you might think; the rubber is herringbone-shaped, which acts like mini lugs that grip well on all types of terrain;\n\n\\-durability, my first pair has clocked 900km and is still in very good condition. The upper and mesh are like new, and the rubber on the outsole is still there.\n\nNegative points:\n\n\\- The comfort of the upper, with little padding; you can feel the pressure of the laces and the semi-rigid plastic parts at times;\n\n\\- The sizing is a bit short (I'm a size 9.5), which leaves very little room in front of the toes, making rides of more than 20 km uncomfortable for the forefoot;\n\n\\- Finally, there's a slight defect on the outsole at the separation between the Pwrrn BP and Pwrrn foams, where gravel can get stuck. Simply remove the stone and fill the hole with a little strong glue, and no more problems.\n\nI've ridden 900 km in my Tempus version 1. Having lost quite a bit of bounce after that distance, I just bought a pair of the new Tempus 2, and after a few runs, I can tell you that they're exactly the same, but more comfortable. There's more padding in the heel, ankle, and tongue, eliminating any discomfort there. I also find the midsole a little softer, but that might be because I went up a half size (the v2 is the same length as the v1), adding a few millimeters of foam under the foot.\n\nI can't wait to see what Saucony does with this model in the future!",

      "As a neutral runner who often buys 1 pair of more stable trainers for recovery days, I can say the tempus is my all time favorite stability trainer.",
      "I will add that I have tried many other shoes this last year (Novablast 4, Triumph 21, GT-2000 12/13, ride 18\u2026.), I have ALWAYS come back to the Tempus",

      "Ran my first half last yr in tempus1\nHolds a steady pace and the response is great. Downside is the cushioning, you will feel it the next day. Especially on the street. I notice the difference when i run on the boardwalk,also  of you have wide feet you will feel that little piece of plastic on the inside.\nWhen they first came out and shoes had good sales every other week, i scooped them up for $80 in the vizi yellow."

    "selftext": "Shoe Model & Size:\nNew Balance 1080 v14 Fresh Foam \u2013 Size 11.5 (Men\u2019s)\n\nFit/Comfort Notes:\nFits true to size. Initially felt very tall and unstable compared to my previous shoes, but after a few runs, I adjusted quickly. Now they feel very cushioned and supportive\u2014like running on a firm cloud.\n\nUse Case:\nRoad running \u2013 daily runs, long runs, and some fartlek work.\n\nDistance Ran:\nJust passed the 30-mile mark.\n\nReason For Buying:\nI\u2019m a new runner (6\u20190\u201d, 225 lbs, averaging 11:00 min/mile) training for a 5K. I started with Brooks Revel 7s, which I thought were a solid step up from the cheap $35 shoes I used to wear. After a few weeks, I developed top-of-foot pain that I self-diagnosed as extensor tendinitis. I decided it was time to get properly fitted.\n\nPersonal Observations:\nThe 1080 v14s have changed everything. Way more cushion and comfort than the Revels. I was hesitant at first due to the height and plush feel, but now I\u2019m fully adjusted and loving them. The pain in my foot has completely gone away. They feel stable and smooth even on longer runs, and I\u2019ve noticed less overall fatigue in my legs and feet.\n\nComparisons:\nCompared to the Brooks Revel 7s, the 1080 v14s are in a completely different league. More cushion, better support, and overall better build quality. The Revels felt flat and harsh by comparison\u2014and apparently, I\u2019m not alone, since the shoe expert who fitted me called them \u201cgarbage\u201d and was shocked they\u2019d made it to a 7th version.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nIf you\u2019re a bigger runner or dealing with foot pain, don\u2019t sleep on proper cushioning and a real shoe fitting. I regret not doing it sooner. The 1080s have completely changed my running experience",

      "Good Afternoon, Geeks!\n\nI\u2019m a new runner\u2014big and slow (6\u20190\u201d, 225 lbs, running around an 11-minute mile).\n\nI got into running to improve my fitness and train for a 5K. I\u2019ve been consistent, running 5 days a week, mixing in long runs and fartleks using the Nike Run Club app.\n\nIn the beginning, I was wearing the Brooks Revel 7. I did my research and thought they were a solid choice! Before that, I never noticed much difference between cheap $35 shoes from Nike or Adidas. So, the Revels felt like a major upgrade\u2014until I got hurt.\n\nAfter a few weeks in them, I started feeling pain on the top of my foot. Self-diagnosis: extensor tendinitis. I took a week off, stretched, and tried to rest, but the pain lingered.\n\nEventually, I scheduled a fitting. The guy helping me\u2014referred to locally as \u201cThe OG Shoe Guy\u201d\u2014took one look at the Revels, squinted, and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019ve made seven versions of this garbage.\u201d Brutal. But he made solid points: the Revels just don\u2019t have the cushioning I apparently need.\n\nHe had me test a pair of New Balance 1080s, and wow\u2014game changer. At first, I felt awkward being so \u201chigh up,\u201d and I worried about stability. But after a few runs, I adjusted, and I\u2019m now completely comfortable in them. Best of all? The pain in my foot has faded.\n\nI\u2019m honestly blown away by the difference. I can\u2019t believe I ran in the wrong shoes for so long. Getting properly fitted was a humbling but eye-opening experience\u2014and 100% worth it.",
      "My 1080s v14s are my favorite shoes to stand or walk in,  but they are too squishy for me to run in.  My lower legs fatigue so quickly,  even at slow paces. Everyone is different, though.  I'm glad they are helping you.",
      "I love my 1080v14s. Just shy of 300mi in and they still feel great for easy and long runs. I\u2019ll do strides in but wouldn\u2019t recommend anything speedier than MP in them.",
      "The new 1080 is nice. The only big caveat of modern New Balance running shoes is that the FreshFoam breaks down so quickly. Of course, it's hard to achieve that amount of squish with a more durable foam. My only advice would be to keep tabs on how many miles you put on them and be aware of how they're feeling around the 300 mile mark."

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/51bugjotqsue1.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1df93bb468cddf1fbca6771646057fe87b41c78e\n\nThe Good, The Bad & The Ugly.\n\nABOUT - 63 year old male. Started running in 2021 following a heart attack at 57...and because my dog refuses to walk.\n\nSix marathons & 12 halves since October 2021.\n\n5k 22.27 - 10k 45.50 - HM 1.36 - FM 3.23 (yesterday)\n\nMidfoot striker - until yesterday!\n\nI got these at the beginning of January and took them out for a shake out two weeks later - just a midweek steady run, which ended up with my 10k PB. Even taking into account a 30 second stop to adjust the laces.\n\nI don't have solid 5 or 10k times, simply because I don't race these distances.\n\nMy second run was a HM in February - another PB. However, at this stage I experienced some fit/lockdown issues, which I don't appear to have fully resolved.\n\nMy third & fourth runs were long runs of 20 & 18 miles in the marathon training block - mainly to try and resolve the fit issue. I did go up half a size, and they are perfect length, but the problem seemed to be too much volume around the toes and tightening the laces caused a bit of bunching. Don't get me wrong, the fit is head & shoulders over the AP3, but I didn't feel overly confident unless I was really picking up the pace.\n\nI resolved the issue by swapping out the insole with one from a NB Fresh Foam shoe - 1080 I think. Although this added 10g, it's not a major issue at my speeds. It was twice as thick, and the extra volume seemed to have worked. However, in the last 4/5 weeks I was getting hotspots on the balls of my feet no matter what shoe I was wearing. Getting a bit worried with the marathon coming up, I went through a regime of foot care creams and experiments with KT Blister tape for the balls of my feet - again, this seemed to work.\n\nYesterday was a whole world of difference though. I was cruising along at my 3.20 goal pace until about Mile 10 when I felt 'the blister' starting - on my sole at the heel. By halfway it was extremely painful, but still on pace, so I found that if I went to a forefoot strike I could cope with it. 18 miles, still on track, but realised I may not be able to hold the forefoot strike until the end.\n\nGot through mile 23, but was beginning to drift back to midfoot & heel which was excrutiating - by this stage I was only about two seconds per mile off the pace and, although I still had plenty left in the legs I decided to just slow it down and make sure I PBed. Miles 24,25 & 26 I had to drop the pace, but try to run on my toes with a higher cadence (194 over the last three). Thankfully, the AP4 has that wonderful rocker which kept me moving forward - although I must have looked odd hobbling/tip-toeing up the final straight.\n\nFinished with a 5min 40sec PB...and one monster blister. This is the first ever blister I've had. The size of a date or walnut - and, no, I am not going to post a picture for any of you foot fetishists out there.\n\nThe shoe performed fantastic though. No stability issues, even though the foam is ludicrously soft - feels more like the NB SC Elite V4, than the AP3. The early rocker keeps you rolling and weighs a lot less than the SC Elite.\n\nThe grip is every bit as good as the AP3 - one of my long runs was in the rain - so no issues for those intending to use them in Manchester. lol\n\nExactly 73 miles in these and the performance is just sweet. There is no wear at all on the outsole - although I'm 55k dripping wet.\n\nYou may want to swap out the laces - I intended to, but they haven't been an issue with me even with heel-lock lacing.\n\nOne of the shoe squeaks intermittently - but that's probably just one of the rods rubbing against the foam.\n\nThe shoe definitely comes alive at MP - although I've not had an issue at slower paces, it does feel a bit cumbersome around corners & turns.\n\nThe best thing though is, this morning I barely any aches. No quad DOMS which I've had on every marathon, and just a little ache around the lower Calf/Achilles area - but this is probably down to me having to run most of the race on my forefoot/toes. These shoes are like Radox/Epsom Salts for the legs\n\nIt's mostly Clint Eastwood, but has a smidgen of Lee Van Cleef. I think it was Eli Wallach who caused the blister.",

      "I needed shoes for my treadmill runs, so I bought ASICS Evoride Speed 2 at $80 minus 20% discount. I've been wearing Nimbus 25, and their foams bottomed up already. After running in Superblast 2 for 2 months I preferred something firmer than Nimbus. The Evoride feel like Magic Speed and they are a bit firmer than Superblast.\n\nSince the Evoride stack height and drop a lot lower than Superblast, the rocking effects is also a lot less, which is unfortunate.\n\nOverall they are good shoes, especially at 50% discount. I don't see ASICS sell many of them at $130 regular price when Novablast is $140 and Magic Speed is $170.",

      "I've run my whole life, either actually running or while playing soccer. The only time in my life I've ever had issues with aches and pains is when I either ran in terrible boots during a Firefighter academy, or when I suddenly changed how much I was training. Both of those times I got shin splints, but they went away after I tapered my running back.\n\nI recently went to Fleet Feet, a store here in Texas, to have scans done to see what kind of running shoes would be best for me. While walking on the tiny scanner and paying way too much attention to how I was walking, I felt myself overpronate very exaggeratedly a couple times. Their scans said I overpronate, and that my arches are weak. They recommended a support type shoe, the New Balance 860. I've had them for several months now, and I'm getting pain and swelling on the lateral side of my right ankle. After a 10k recently the bones in the middle of my foot (metatarsals according to google) felt very sore and hurt for a couple days. It's become normal to have swelling in my right ankle after any run over 3 miles even though I've never had any pains before getting these shoes.\n\nAfter typing it all out it seems pretty clear, but could getting a support type shoe, then throwing a support insert into the shoe, cause me to supinate and cause these pains? A friend has suggested that it's the first time I've ever run with proper form and that my feet are adjusting because they're weak. I played soccer very competitively for 10+ years and never had any issues with foot or ankle pains despite the constant side-to-side movement, so I'm sceptical about that. Anyways, some tips or insight would be appreciated."

    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/sdk178ezvnue1.jpg?width=2663&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fce29fe5044fe79d05806e42b6e8a6953eba0041\n\n**Total distance ran:**\n\n75km so far\n\n**Type of runs:**\n\nLonger runs/Interval sessions\n\n**My profile:** 180cm/70kg\n\nPaces: All the way from 4:45 to 3:35 min/km - average 4:30 min/km\n\nStrike Type: Midfoot\n\n80km per week\n\nRecently picked up a pair of On Cloudboom Zone last month - hoping to use them for quicker tempo/speed training.\n\nInitial impressions of the shoe were positive. They are very nice and lightweight. Believe they have around a 6mm drop. Aesthetically, I think they look great although I would maybe have preferred some other colour options beyond the white that is currently available. Materials I think are pretty nice. They are quite similar to the Cloudboom strike in terms of the foam and overall construction - although obviously not as minimal given they are training focused rather than race focused. The upper maybe lets the side down a bit - around the heel/ankle of the shoe is quite unforgiving and stiff and maybe my biggest problem area - not a lot of padding around the places where it could also be beneficial - but think this is done to keep the weight minimised. It is also maybe not the most breathable upper ever.\n\nBeing excited with my new running shoes arriving, made that age old error of unboxing and taking them outside for a quick spin. Initially thought the fit was fine and just a bit stiffer given the fact they were new but not really paying too much attention to it of I am being honest. As far as I am aware these shoes are only available from the On website (where I purchased mine) and in physical On stores. I opted here for the 43 as I currently have a pair of On Cloud Eclipse in 43 in rotation - which fit perfectly - and had seen a YouTube review recommending that they were true to size or to size down.\n\nFrom my first runs, now up to around 75 km, including a mix of longer/quicker efforts, they are really responsive and bouncy - and think they are a great shoe for covering a wide range of paces.  Have tried them all the way down to 3:35/km for 3k reps and they felt super, especially great since they don't have a carbon plate - and can still emulate that kind of racier feel.\n\nMy main issue with the Cloudboom Zone is that they seem to be manufactured much too small in length (compared at least with my current Cloud Eclipse) - should have definitely taken at least an EU 44. It feels quite wide but not overly wide in the toebox, which is nice, but its much narrower and quite stiff in the heel and in the mid-foot up against the tongue padding. My foot is pretty crushed - and this really doesn't feel great at all - especially at the top end of the foot. The lacing system is not super either, not quite sure why they've given these shoes such bad laces. They come undone pretty easily and they are quite difficult to maintain any degree of tightness, especially the bottom half of the shoe, and maybe not long enough either if you want to use a runners knot. Across all of my runs so far, the upper consistently digs in underneath my ankles and given me some quite bad blistering/bleeding. Initially I just put this down to breaking in the shoes a bit, no problem I wanted to give it some time, but I think it's not something that's necessarily going to go away - with the shoe being too small (my fault) as well as just stiff/narrow at the ankle/heel with minimal padding.\n\nSince my main issue is with the sizing - I would have normally just put this down to me being an idiot and buying/keeping the wrong size (expensive mistake given these shoes retail at \u20ac220.00/$210.00/\u00a3200.00). But what really irritated me is that it doesn't seem possible to even test/compare different sizes unless you are willing to order several pairs from On or visit an On store (which I don't live near). I tried to explain this to On about my sizing inconsistency issue - and they said I had 30 days to check the fit indoors at home before I decided to take them outside. Arguably fair - but super inconvenient - when this is the primary way I think people will purchase these shoes. Not sure why they exclusively sell them on their own website (but I would be interested to know if there was a reason behind it). They also had some other stupidly generic and unhelpful suggestions like trying them at a local retailer that sells On (Not possible for this model as far as I could work out) and also trying thicker socks (not really helpful either just due to the already snug fit), or even trying other models like the Cloudboom Strike - if I was \"seeking an alternative to the Cloudboom Zone that blends speed and comfort\".\n\nDespite this I wouldn't write this shoe off just yet - think it's an exciting offering especially with how good it felt using it for intervals - a great bridge between something everyday and something raceday. Just think there's some real problematic inconsistencies in the sizing - which makes them very hard to recommend - although possibly this is resolved if they are available to test in local retailers. And more generally think the heel counter and laces could be improved to get a more comfortable fit. The price is also high compared to other manufacturers similar shoes - but I think that can often be the case with On's line up across the board and isn't necessarily specific to this model - so maybe another reason not to buy.\n\nTLDR: Bought the On Cloudboom Zone, it's not possible to test these for size- as you can only order from On's website/physical stores. They feel too small and very uncomfortable in my normal size - for what should be a very nice tempo/interval shoe",

The La Sportiva Prodigio Pro joins the VJ Ultra 3, Norda 005, and Puma Deviate Nitro Elite Trail in my recent stable of recent additions. All these shoes are just so nice. These shoes (along with other faves like the Tecton X 3, Agravic Speed Ultra, Vectiv Pro 2, S/Lab Genesis, Kjerag, and Norda 001) make me want to hit the trails more than on the road these days, especially with the nicer weather and longer sunlight.\n\nThe innovations going on in the trail shoes world has been amazing over the past few years - much more interesting stuff going on than with road shoes IMO. Well, trail running requires a lot more in terms of dealing with various uneven terrains and environments, extreme elevation gains and descents, and ultra distances. A lot more fine-tuning is involved.\n\nHad my first run yesterday of around 15 miles with 3,000ft of elevation gain and, I have to say, the Prodigio Pro lives up to the hype and the praise it's been getting. It's got the \"magic\" in terms of the fine balance between long-distance comfort, bounce, propulsion, protection, grip, agility, stability, and versatility to handle all types of terrains. \n\nIt's just one run so more mileage will be needed to compare to the VJ Ultra 3 and Norda 005 which are roughly in the same vein (non-plated trail \"super\" shoes) and in which I've logged around 50 miles each. Just based on the first run, the Prodigio Pro feels and rides closer to the 005 than the Ultra 3, which was not what I was expecting. The PP sits noticeably lower to the ground than the U3. To me, the U3 is more comparable to the Tecton X 3 and Vectiv Pro 3 but without a plate. It's in the max-stack category (around 40mm heel stack height) for trail shoes.\n\nAnyway, the Prodigio Pro is a great all-rounder and I enjoyed every mile running in it yesterday and I'm looking forward to my next run and pick up the pace more. The first run yesterday was fairly relaxed with some pickup in pace here and there. This is a fast trail shoe - light (8.8oz or 250g) in my US men's 8.5+ or EU 41.5, nimble for technical terrains and mountain running, and a bouncy and very responsive midsole. The outsole grip is superb as well, inspiring confidence when going fast downhill or on rocky terrains. A trail banger for sure!",

    "title": "adidas Prime X 2 Strung - the king of bounce, my take after 400 km",
    "selftext": "How are you, my fellow runners?\n\nI want to share my thoughts about adidas Prime X 2 Strung, which I nicknamed \"the king of bounce\". I already raced in them and I paid 270$ for a pair. I have to say it was worth it, even if now you can grab them at significant discounts. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!\n\n**Purpose**\n\nI have retired my Novablast 4 so I needed a training shoe to prepare for my upcoming marathon in September. It will be my first marathon so I take it quite seriously but still with a big dose of joy.\n\n**Fit**\n\nBased on reviews, I bought a bigger size. Normally I wear size 44, and I went for 44 2/3. After the first runs I was left with corn on the top of my middle toes, both feet. I feel like the front of the shoe is squeezing my toes inwards. I have skinny, ectomorph, long feet. Egyptian shape.\n\nI have changed the socks and I always use the polyamide/Dryarn\u00ae ones. I have also decided to use shoe trees. The problem disappeared. Still, I am left with a bit of room in the back of the shoe, they do not hug my feet like a sock. After a natural shoe break in and my interference, it seems like it is all good now.\n\n**Usage**\n\nI already did two races in them and currently, very slowly, I'm increasing the mileage from 50-60km per week, to around 75-100 km per week. These shoes are joyful and make my tempo/long runs feel much more tolerable. It is my main choice for every training unit now, but I'm thinking about buying some other more casual pair with lower drop for very, very slow running. I don't like doing the slowest units in Prime X 2 Strung. In some way I feel like the shoe is always forcing me to give more in order to compress and use the technology stuffed in it.\n\n**Race debrief**\n\nI took these shoes for a fun test in Bergamo. Two races one after another. 12,5 km night trail run on Saturday and a half-marathon on Sunday.\n\n1. Yes I took the unstable, 50mm foam shoe for a trail run. Don't do it. I did it because I haven't got a pair for such events. I understand the mistake now and also the importance of the terrain awareness, and how it changes with the weather. Without prolonged rain it would be a different story. These shoes are not a good choice for any other terrain than flat road racing. End of story. It was raining and foggy. The ascents on paved roads and stones went pretty well and I had a lot of fun, but during slippery descents, on muddy sections I had to be so cautious that I actually forgot i'm running. It was pure survival. Questionable balance, no grip. Few times I was on the verge of twisting both ankles. I survived. Time to buy shoes especially for trail running.\n2. With these shoes I have set my pb for half marathon, even running 12,5km the day before. My plan was to run it more recreationally, slower than my previous hm pb tempo which was around 4:47/km. In Bergamo, I ran my half marathon in 1:33:19 which is 4:25/km and was left shocked at how it happened. Literally I was blown away with the result because It wasn\u2019t my goal or I didn\u2019t feel like pushing. It just happened. I love how the shoes reciprocate the effort you give. When you are able to compress the foam, it is really giving. I felt so good and the fatigue appeared just at the very end. I feel like without running on the previous day I could be even faster!\n\n**Longevity and materials used**\n\nIt is too early to judge, however I am very satisfied with the overall quality output I am receiving. From the top to the bottom, it feels like a top tier, and let's be real, better be a top tier for the value we are paying for an ultimate training/racing shoe.\n\n**TL:DR**\n\nTechnological doping. Perfect for flat racing, long/tempo training. Not stable. Wrongly used, can cause injuries. Mainly for people with good mind-muscle connection and overall balance. If you compress them well, you will bounce like hell.\n\nIf you can grab it at a major discount for 200-220$. Go for it.",

      "Salomon Aero Glide 3 is a surprisingly good shoe. It's too early for me to know for sure (I only have a couple miles on it), but it seems like a Superblast and Triumph 20/21 had a baby. A bit lighter and bouncier than a Triumph, with the same goldilocks cushion.",
      "Anybody else here tried the KD900? I managed to get it online for a last pair deal which happened to be my size for only $40. When I saw it at that price i just said why not and bought it lol\n\nI'll get it in the next 3-5 days. I'm just curious about kiprun shoes in general.",
      "I had my first run today in the Diadora Mythos Blueshield Volo 5, a gentle warm up before a track session: I\u2019m really really surprised but how good they felt. \n\nThey are supposed to be a support shoe, but they are really different from my usual daily trainers, the Adrenaline 24: lot softer, a bit looser, less structured, responsive. \n\nGreat upper, very light with minimal tongue\u2026 You could say it\u2019s similar to shoes like the Kinvara or Hyperion 2. The high drop is noticeable, but I\u2019m a heel striker at moderate pace, so I enjoy that. The fit is slightly short, but during the run I didn\u2019t experience any hot spot.\n\nThe Blueshield foam feels different from anything else I tried in the past, kinda like some memory foam, adapting nicely to the foot strike. They are soft, maybe similar to a Clifton or a NB 1080, but there\u2019s less foam and they are quite nice to pick up the pace in. I\u2019m not an heavy runner but I could feel bottoming out, but that\u2019s something I don\u2019t mind.\n\nI\u2019m not sure they are supportive enough for longer runs, but my ankles are happy so far. And no soreness in my adductors, something I usually get from super soft and unstable shoes. Really fun to run in, will take them on a longer run soon and report",

I'm also looking at Magic Speed 4, EVO SL, Hyperion Max 2, but I can get the ES3 about $20-$40 cheaper than those. Pretty sure ES4 is too narrow in toe box for me.",
      "Has anybody else experienced arch trouble in Saucony\u2019s support shoes? \n\nFor me personally it\u2019s the arch in my right foot that really rubs \u2014 and can form a painful blister. I find this in both the Hurricane 24 and the Tempus when the runs go above 12 miles (19km or so). \n\nSome more of my context: I used to run exclusively in Brooks Adrenalines and Hoka Arahis. Had a great time and most importantly of all, no pain/injuries. Since then I have used a few neutral shoes which have been great fun, but as I close in on a spring marathon, I\u2019ve had a few niggles from those shoes. \n\nSo Ive gone back to the surety of shoes with stability/support features for the last few weeks to make sure I get to race day with no unnecessary little (or large) injuries. \n\nBut while Brooks GTS and Hoka\u2019s support systems seem to work for me, Saucony give me this pain. Frustrating! Not world ending of course, but yeah disappointing as it\u2019s not what I expected at all (thought these were boring but safe bets). \n\nI\u2019d be curious to hear if any others have similar experience. Fwiw the Tempus and Hurricane are both now on 153km so nearly 100 miles.",

I had it shipped from japan! I can't wait to use it for my next long run. I've never been excited to try a running shoe like this before lol. Not just because of the shoes but because it's almost impossible to get it in my size or just any size actually!",
      "Besides New Balance, Asics is the only company that is really making premium level wide running shoes.\nOther shoes \"can work\" but for daily training there are no other shoes i have found that are better for wide foot runners. (I rotate between the Nimbus and Novablast).",

      "I hope that ASICS starts making more of their shoes in size 14. I\u2019d love to try the Metaspeeds.",
      "perspective of a 50+ old casual runner.   \n  \n**Nimbus 25**: I like the Nimbus for my easy runs. A lot of YT reviews say they don't see the point of Nimbus as Novablast is just as good. I'm not ashamed to admit that my easy runs are only 6:00min/km or slower.  I can even go as slow as 6:45min/km and it still feels 'natural', like the shoe was designed for this sort of speed. I find running at 6:45min/km 'unnatural' in Novablast, for comparison.\n\nAt slow paces, the Novablast doesn't 'come alive', when you force yourself to run at 6:00min/km in NB, it seems sort of odd, that you are spending effort to 'hold back' the shoe. \n\nI also like the Nimbus 27 Asics Track Club white/blue colorway... I don't have it yet, but that will be my next Nimbus...\n\n**Superblast 2**: I like the pink/purple colorway. Its a firm shoe but I'm happy to have a shoe rotation that includes a firm shoe. It hasn't caused me any pain/problems and its great for steady/long runs faster than easy pace. But I don't think its very good at intervals/strides compared to Nike Zoom Fly 6. I have tried SB2, Nike ZF6 and VF3 multiple 5k parkruns, when I try to kick in the last km, the ZF6 and VF3 respond a lot better  \n  \n**Novablast 4:** its my cheap daily trainer if I need to run in a drizzle and expect my shoe to pick up dirt/mud. Its way better than Pegasus 39/40. Won't be getting NB5 because SB2 can do whatever it can.\n\n**S4+ Yogiri.** Just got this from Japan (SB2 was out of stock at the Asics store), haven't run in them yet. Supposedly designed for 5:30-5:40 min/km pace (S4=4 hour marathon and I guess S4+ means 4+ hr marathon?), that would be just nice for HM training for a slow runner like myself. This started off as a Japan only model, which means that it is designed for the Japanese runner's physique/average weight.  Most youtubers probably don't run as slow as 5:30-5:40min/km pace so they may not get the point of the shoe."

Took them out today for a nice 12k mostly easy with 3k of those a bit faster just to see how that would be.\n\nQuite thick in most ways, weighed them at 300g in 42,5 (9,5 US). Voluminous midsole, pretty plush ride and a roomy upper that seems to fit my kinda wide forefoot easily. Maybe a bit warm but breathability is ok.\n\nI could easily find a nice, easy pace to groove into and running in the MagMax quickly felt natural, which came as a pleasant surprise (they are my first max. cushioned shoes). They feel best suited for easy/steady pace, and I am quite curious to see how they do on longer runs, say 20k+.\n\nIt's definitely no issue to increase the tempo somewhat, but MP already feels like a bit of an effort, mostly because of the shoe's weight and the way its foam absorbs a lot of energy but does not return as much - which is totally cool for a max. cushioned trainer I guess.\n\nVery happy to add them to my rotation (mostly plated Saucony).\n\n\\[edit: typos\\]",

Very airy upper and during the quick treadmill 5K I did it was pretty bouncy to make up for the weight.\n\nI don't think it will join the rotation, and I wouldn't really recommend it at the price.

    "selftext": "Not sure this sub needed another AP4 review at this point, but I wanted to get my thoughts out somewhere and Strava wasn't the place to do it, so here we are...\n\n**Profile**: M22 176 cm, 57 kg former college runner, forefoot striker. Fairly noticeable pronation on right foot.\n\nAverage weekly volume around 100 to 115 km in peak weeks, though currently rebuilding from injury so hovering around 70 to 80km\n\n**Relevant PBs**: 15:27 5k, 34:30 10k, 1:18 HM (yeah, I know, the longer ones are overdue to be broken)\n\n**Context**: I've been running competitively for several years now, but only really got into the world of running shoes in 2024. Not for lack of geekiness, but lack of occasion, and opportunity, perhaps. This year, I spent far more on running shoes than I should have... enough to make my family and friends sigh in exasperation at the number of packages delivered to our house. \n\nIn my defense, I always tell them that I'm simply stocking up for the next three years in advance. As I say that, I think I hear another delivery at the door.... ahem. Well, I can say that at least I got these Pro 4s for a very good deal, $150 USD incl. tax and shipping off of Mercari. \n\nAs someone who's traditionally stuck to Saucony and Nike, Adidas has definitely earned my love this year with their lineup and I see myself continuing to follow their releases with interest from now on.\n\nSo, onto the actual review, let's see.\n\n**Type of run**: 3km warmup @ 4:35 / km, 8 x 1km sub threshold @ 3:35 km, 3km cooldown\n\nImmediately, I felt that the upper and fit was much better than the AP3. As I was expecting from all the numerous reviews I'd read, it was much more comfortable and I had no issues with slippage. The Pro 3s gave me endless issues with the lockdown, even after trying heel lock lacing and replacing the laces. I even tried using speed laces with them, but felt that I had to tie them so tight that it gave me pressure and lace bite, so  I gave up on that setup. \n\nHowever, I should mention that unlike most people who had to go a half size up from the 3 to 4, I have narrow feet and sit in between sizes (42.5 and 43 EU) in every brand except for Saucony. So it's rather likely that my lockdown issues stemmed at least partially from a width and length discrepancy in addition to the poor lacing.\n\nThe Pro 3 also gave me persistent issues in aggravating my posterior tibial tendonitis. I haven't been able to use them consistently until recently after a few weeks of strength work, but still I find myself a bit reluctant to reach for them. I will say the only reason why I kept giving them a chance is precisely because I enjoyed how responsive the ride felt.\n\nWith that being said, I was surprised to find out that the Pro 4 did not give me the same issue despite many people indicating a relative decrease in stability. The difference in softness was quite apparent at first step in, and only became even more clear as the run went on. I was very pleased with how at home they felt even on my warmup, as opposed to the 3 which felt a bit awkward and harsh at anything slower than 4:20 km pace.\n\nWhile the 4 definitely feels somewhat less punchier than the 3, which I would describe as stepping off of a catapult with each stride, I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing. The 4 gave me a very smooth ride that felt effortless and seamless on the intervals. Despite feeling like I was not going faster, I was hitting faster pace on each rep.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I have not run a full marathon yet, but I can definitely imagine that \"disappearing on the foot feel\" and more forgiving ride would be greatly appreciated in the latter stages of the race as you begin to fatigue. I've learned that sometimes what you need is not to be distracted by the shoe.\n\n**Some comparisons to other supershoes I've tried:**\n\nVaporfly 2 \u2010 A timeless supershoe, also the first one I've ever tried. I still feel I'd prefer the Vaporfly for anything approaching 10km to 5km race pace, as it's fairly more propulsive. \n\nIn a HM, I'm not sure which I would pick, the verdict is out on that one. I do think the Pro 4 is slightly more forgiving, more natural feeling, as I don't like how the Vaporfly 'sinks' a bit into the ground before rebounding, the squishiness still feels unnatural to me after having done many workouts and races in it. The Pro 4 is also definitely better around the turns no question, and likely better in terms of traction, though I haven't tested that.\n\nAlphafly 1 \u2010 The OG Alpha. A crazy wild and fun ride that's hard to beat for any shoe past and present. The AF1 wins in terms of pure fun, but in terms of performance I'd say they're very comparable. \n\nAlphafly 3 \u2010 I see the AF3 as being the more firm counterpart to the AP4. Not nearly as fun as AF1, but provides a well cushioned ride that helps you lock into a rhythm and endlessly maintain it. I think I'd reach for the AP4 before these as they feel slightly less clunky.\n\nEndorphin Elite \u2010 Most aggressive supershoe I've tried by far. I genuinely felt like I wasn't fast enough to even be using it... honestly can't see myself using these for a half. If you can put a lot of force into these, you get a lot back. But it's not gonna do the work for you.\n\nEndorphin Pro 3 \u2010 The Pro 3 is a great workout shoe and feels more nimble, more snappy, more firm. I quite like these for short intervals. I wouldn't pick them in any race distance over the AP4 except a road mile maybe?\n\nEndorphin Pro 4 \u2010 A lot of people joke about how the EP4s are basically super trainers and honestly, yeah. But they do fulfill that role pretty well, so I'm happy to use them as such grabbing them on steep discount. They're great for steady continuous efforts like a progressive long run, or hill repeats. Race day though? AP4 no question, of course.\n\nCloudboom Strike \u2010 Pretty similar in terms of softness underfoot I feel. The Speedboard gives it a more aggressive transition to toe off which is something I like, but I think it's slightly held back by the rocker. It's a solid, fun shoe, and seems to be somewhat in between an aggressive and more relaxed shoe, whereas the AP4 seems to hit a better sweetspot in that regard.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nWell, if you made it this far, I wanna say thanks for reading through all my walls of text. Honestly a part of me wants to start racing marathons to justify all the marathon shoes I have on my rack. Unfortunately, I know that I still have plenty of unfinished business on the track and in the shorter distances. \n\nHowever, when the time comes for me to tackle the marathon, I think the Pro 4 is definitely amongst my top options for doing so. It's a great shoe. I wouldn't say it's an absolute must have if any of the other top racers on the market work for you, but then again I guess you could say that for any shoe nowadays. Still, it's a worthy addition for anyone who likes softer, comfortable, forgiving yet fast racing shoes and especially if you've found that Adidas works for you. \n\n",

      "Half size up (US/EU  - Adidas converts a bit strange to UK sizes) from Adios Pro 3 to the 4 is definitely the way to go. Adios Pro 4 is TTS. Adios Pro 3 was slightly long and a snug fit was also needed to get a secure lock down.",
      "I just got the ap3 and upper is complicated but amazing shoe still. I dont like that they have gone more narrow with the ap4.\n\nHow do you find the EP4 as a forefoot striker? I have a pair i love but the high drop does bother me sometimes",

    "selftext": "About me: 100 kg, run 35-40 km pr week and am mostly a midfoot striker. Half Marathon time of 1:48\n\nAfter circling around these shoes for a good amount of time, I finally swiped the card, when Aliexpress had the march super sale. I ended up paying 150\u20ac with all taxes and free delivery to Europe. They arrived last Friday, and what better way to try them, than taking them with me to run Berlin Half Marathon.\n\nThe fit: I have purchased Li-Ning shoes before, so I knew they would fit me. I use 44,5 in Li-Ning, Adidas and Brooks, with an average footwidth. The toe box feels wide, so I don't think sizing up is needed if you have a slightly wide foot - but Li-Ning has a great sizing guide on Aliexpress to use.\n\nUpper material: The upper is made by a woven nylon mesh, which has a slight soft feel on the inside, and the outside feels more like a classic woven polyester. It's a thin shoe, so it's best used for warmer races. At cold temperatures, the wind will blow straight through it.\n\nNow onto the more interesting stuff. The shoes drop is supposedly 5 mm, with a stack of 38mm and a forefoot of 33 mm. I have ran in everything from 10 to 4 mm drop, but I will say the drop doesn't feel super aggressive. The midsole is made by Li-Nings own Boom Foam, in a new revision called Super Boom. It has a distinct squeezing feeling, and walking in it gives a clear indication of the rebounce from this shoe. The carbon plate is a full plate made from T1000 carbon. The outsole is nothing special. It's grippy enough, and I didn't feel any risk of slipping. I wouldn't trust it with my life in rain, but I wouldn't be scared of running on wet tarmac.\n\nThe run: Trying a brand new pair of shoes at a competition is probably not the smartest, but I thought what the heck. The worst would be a couple of blisters and a slower time. But it turned out to be an amazing experience. This is my first ever proper pair of supershoes, so I don't have much to compare with. The rocker was solid, and early I could feel how the springyness of the midsole kicked back the energy put into it. \n\nI started out running 5:15 min/km, and at that speed, the shoe didn't feel super stable. There's not a lot of lateral stability, so you need to land midfoot and forward. When we upped the speed to 5:05, the shoe improved, and despite being a supershoe, it was perfectly stable, even at my modest speed. The last 3 km, I increased to 4:45, and at that point the rocker and stability became more pronounced. This shoe will definitly perform better, once you get above a certain threshold - one I suspect is around 4:30-4:20 min/km.\n\nLast mentions: I chatted with a few Chinese shoe youtubers, and they said the Feidian 5 Elite is a bit hard in the sole. Now I weigh 100 kg, and have no prior experience  but for me that wasn't an issue. But if you're a light runner, it might be worth taking into account.\n\nOverall it was a 10/10 shoe experience, and Im glad I took the gamble. The shoe is amazing value, and I have no problems recommending it to others.\n",

      "I say it this way... I have 3 pairs of them now.\n\nCan agree to everything what OP said.\n\nIts a Solid 10/10... My race shoe of the year for sure.\n\nI also dont know why so many Chinese runners say its too firm. The New super boom foam is a marshmallow compared to old boom foam used in the elite 1-4 and ultra 3 and 4. Its not too soft not too firm.\nBiggest difference between the foams is now, old boom foam was super firm beaded peba, where you had to put tons of energy in (to get also tons of energy out) vs now feels like a firmer ZoomX version.\n\nI weight 70kg currently I think it has the perfect balance between firm and soft. For a 70kg runner it feels a lot more stable.\n\nThe t1000 carbon plate is nothing special but suits its low price point.\n\nMy 2 Cents to it.\n\nThanks for your Review",

Lots of track training, hills and tempo work. Was looking for a fast training shoe for my rotation arsenal. Never liked the original Streakfly as it always felt too squishy and not much energy return. It never found a place in my training rotation as there were better options available to run fast (intervals) or run longer (tempo).\n\nFirst impressions:\nSuper light and looks like a spike - looks made for track work and speed sessions.\n\nFit:\nTrue to size but not super generous - perfect with a light race sock. Again, confirmation of its spike like fit.\n\nRun test:\nFast. I could just stop there. After all, that is what they are made for and they certainly deliver. A big plus is the stability, which was very good and they handled the bends well at speed. Managed to score some fast 200m times (for me) and they felt very natural. You don't notice the plate at all, the roll through to the toe off is very natural and not overly springy. Nice level of cushion and no issues with calf muscle or achilles after the session.\n\nVerdict: \nThese will be my go to track shoes for fast reps to save my legs and put in some fast times. I would think anything from 1k down would be ideal. You could go longer but they are spike like and fast. I personally prefer some more cushion and control in my longer intervals. I will also race in them for an upcoming mile road race. May consider the SF2 for a 5k depending on how they go in training.\n*",
      "TL;DR - should I add a stability shoe to my rotation given I recently had a mild post tib tendinopathy?\n\nI've been running for around 2 years, haven't had any major injuries but I've had two issues on ankle tendons - a peroneal tendinopathy, and more recently a post tib one. Neither were huge issues, I never had to stop running since pain was mild at most, and managed them through load management and PT. But it made me wonder, now that I'm getting back to the volume that got me hurt (75km/week) if I should add a stability trainer to possibly help in avoiding future issues. My current rotation has\n\n\\- the Gel Cumulus 26\n\n\\- the \"Olympikus Corre 3\" (generic daily trainer, like a Pegasus I think)\n\n\\- the \"Olympikus Corre Vento 2\" (lightweight racing flat for speed days) - most mileage is on the first two models.\n\nI've received different advice which has become confusing. On one side, my recent post tib issue was mild and the symptoms were pretty much gone after 1 month, so I assume I don't have severe pronation issues. On the other hand, I guess adding a stability trainer in the rotation wouldn't hurt even if it's not super needed? Some folks told me to get a gait analysis from a local store but the FAQ says that it's pseudo-science (thanks FAQ!). I've also been considering looking for a PT that is more specialized in running but what kind of assessment should I be asking him to do?\n\nFinally, I comprehend injuries are multi-factorial, I'm not expecting the shoe to be a magic pill but just an aid in the grand scheme of things. Any advice is appreciated, still a bit of a noob but getting there :)",
      "What\u2019s the difference between Asics S4 and S4+?",
      "Sounds like something you should ask your PT.",
      "Looking for a shoe for an upcoming half marathon in 6 weeks, targeting 1:30.\n\nVaporfly 3's look like a decent deal at the moment (\u00a3170 direct from Nike), but I've been doing my faster workouts in a pair of endorphin speed 3s which I just love so I'm also thinking whether it might be best to stick with Saucony for maybe their Elite 2s.\n\nWondering if anyone has any experience with both, or any other suggestions."

    "title": "Hoka Cielo X1 and Hoka Cielo X1 2.0 comparison",
    "selftext": "Hoka Cielo X1 (2024)\n\nUS13\n\nFit/Comfort Notes: True to size. Advertised as narrow, but actually fits wider than most Hokas. The upper is stiff and not the most comfortable. Lockdown is decent, but the stock laces are bad. Overall, not a plush fit, but secure enough for long efforts.\n\nUse Case: Used primarily for races: half-marathons and a full Ironman marathon. Also tested on long road runs (20+ km).\n\nDistance Ran: ~350 km (~217 miles)\n\nReason For Buying: Looking for a race-legal shoe with high cushioning and stability for long-course triathlon. Switched from Nike after being disappointed by Vaporfly (too unstable, narrow platform) and Invincible 3 (heel slippage, uncomfortable upper).\n\nPersonal Observations:\n\nOne of the most cushioned racing shoes available \u2013 extremely protective even at 110+ kg (240+ lbs). Aggressive rocker helps maintain turnover late into long efforts. Solid stability and support over long distances, especially post biking in Ironman. Outsole durability is excellent \u2013 full rubber coverage except for a strange bare section on the back heel.\n\nDownsides: stiff upper, subpar laces, and the fit is wider than expected. Weight is higher than typical super shoes, but irrelevant at my body weight \u2013 the overall support more than compensates.\n\nComparisons: Far more supportive than Vaporfly/Alphafly for mid-pack and heavier runners. I trained mostly in Asics Superblast 2, which complemented it well (but those aren\u2019t Ironman legal). Cielo X1 was my go-to race shoe for 2024.\n\nHoka Cielo X1 2.0 (2025)\n\nUS13\n\nFit/Comfort Notes: True to size. Massive improvement in the upper: better heel structure, more breathable, and slightly narrower \u2013 now it actually fits like a modern race shoe. Laces are traditional and work better. Still roomy for a super shoe, but much improved over v1.\n\nUse Case: Used for tempo runs\n\nDistance Ran: ~21 km (~13 miles)\n\nReason For Buying: Was excited about the updated version hoping for same midsole performance with improved fit and comfort. Looked like a perfect evolution on paper.\n\nPersonal Observations:\n\nUpper changes are great \u2013 fit and lockdown issues from v1 are solved. Unfortunately, the midsole took a hit. Foam under the heel has been reduced both in width and volume, and outsole cuts are much deeper. This causes instability in the heel \u2013 noticeable even during walking. During runs, it forces a midfoot/forefoot strike, which I can manage up to ~15 km, but after that my form degrades and I rely more on my heel \u2013 something v1 handled much better. I don\u2019t trust v2 over longer distances or during the Ironman marathon. My concerns were confirmed by several YouTube reviewers (lighter runners too), who also noted instability. One key design change was moving the midsole cut from lateral to medial side \u2013 similar to Adios Pro 3. The difference is that Adios has a stiffer heel and isn\u2019t as prone to compression. For me (slight supinator), the change might help theoretically, but the execution doesn\u2019t work at heavier weight.\n\nComparisons: Cielo X1 2.0 feels like a different shoe altogether. Better fit, worse stability. Compared to v1, it\u2019s less suited for heavy runners or fatigued form. I chose to return it and stick with Mach X2 for training and Cielo X1 for racing. It\u2019s a shame the original wasn\u2019t kept in the lineup alongside X1 2.0 and Rocket ",

    "title": "Superblast 2 @ 1000km. I was wrong about these shoes",
    "selftext": "Me: 189cm/6ft2 75kg Mar 2:56 HM 1:18\n\nShoes from last 12 months: New Balance 880, Endorphin Speed 4, Boston 12, Vaporfly 3\n\nDespite the instant-classic status of these shoes, I couldn\u2019t find a 1000km+ review of them, so I figured I\u2019d do my part, especially since my opinion on them has completely changed.\n\nI bought these shoes for Marathon training, with a specific eye on something that would allow me to build some speed work into my long runs.\n\nMy first impression was a mix of \u201cI don\u2019t see what all the fuss is about\u201d, and \u201cI can\u2019t believe I just paid so much money for a pair of shoes\u201d. \u00a0\n\nI absolutely adore the foam on my VF3\u2019s, and in my mind I was expecting something similar from the SB2\u2019s - somewhat soft but with a nice rocker and extremely propulsive, leading to that feeling of just wanting to run more and faster.\n\nIn reality the SB2 just felt too firm to create any propulsive ride, and without much of a rocker, I was left with the impression of slamming two giant slabs of foam into the ground. There was definitely a better return than the 880s, but overall I felt like I had a shoe that was neither nimble enough for speed work, nor supportive enough to keep my feet/joints happy on 35km+ runs.\n\nOn positive initial impression was that the shoes were\u00a0*extremely*\u00a0comfortable around the foot. I went up half a size to a 12.5, which I\u2019m not sure was necessary but definitely didn\u2019t hurt. Something I\u2019ve struggled with in previous shoes is that when the upper felt breathable like the VF3 or Boston 12s, it didn\u2019t feel like it conformed particularly well, where the upper on my New Balance 880s fit well, but immediately made my feet overheat. The SB2s had the best of both worlds, and also conformed to my foot arch nicely.\n\nIn general though underwhelment (new word!) was to the point that I actually looked into whether I hae a fake pair (I didn\u2019t). But I also couldn\u2019t return them so I was going to make damn sure I got my value out of such a large expense.\n\nSo I persisted, using them for long and easy/recovery runs since there was nothing else in my rotation to fill that space. At least it gave me plenty of opportunity to tell anyone who would listen to me how overrated the SB2\u2019s were.\n\nAt 250km of usage I noticed something strange. Normally on a long run at around 30km my feet and legs begin to really feel the fatigue, and my run gait transitions from a \u201cbounce\u201d to more of a \u201cshuffle\u201d. For whatever reason (maybe they\u2019d worn in a bit, maybe I\u2019d adapted), this wasn\u2019t happening with the SB2s - while that propulsive pop wasn\u2019t as pronounced, it didn\u2019t seem to diminish as the miles ticked over, and I finished my long runs feeling like I\u2019d put far less stress on my feet.\n\nAround the same time I had another unexpected occurrence, when I found myself at an unplanned speedwork session with only my SB2s (normally I\u2019d be in the VF3s or Speed 4s). To my surprise I put down my first ever sub 3min kilometre, without particularly trying for it. To be clear, they\u2019re definitely not as fast as my speed workout specific shoes, but it made me realise that if I wanted to put real pace on the SB2\u2019s I could.\n\nSomewhere along the last 250km, the Superblast 2s had transitioned from a shoe that couldn\u2019t really do anything particularly well, to a shoe that I now felt excited to use for basically any workout.\u00a0\n\nThey have remained that way for the next 800km. They've held up freakishly well, and are in better condition than my Endorphin Speed 4s that have about 1/3rd the distance on them. I\u2019ve now got 1100km on the shoes, and no immediate plans to replace them - while they\u2019re lacking perhaps some of that 250km magic, I can still take them out on the weekends and feel like I can do a good long session without worrying about causing damage to my feet.\n\nPerhaps the icing on the cake came about a fortnight ago. After a hard long run in my VF3s in preparation for a marathon, I caused some muscle damage in my right foot (\u201cperoneal tenosynovitis\u201d, whatever that is) due to inadequate rest the next day and wearing a pair of Adidas Stan Smiths around the city. A panicked trip to the physio resulted in the advice \u201cyou\u2019ll probably be fine to race, but put your Stan Smiths away until after the marathon, and even when you\u2019re not running, you need to wear the most supportive comfortable shoe you can find, which may be a plated shoe, or maybe your Superblast 2s, you\u2019ll need to work that out with trial and error\u201d.\n\nSo as you may be able to guess by now, after a pretty extensive wash to get them as white as possible, my SB2s are now getting worn around the office, at least until my foot fully recovers.\n\nSummary: 250km of being underwhelmed, 800km+ of the greatest shoe I\u2019ve ever owned.",

      "howd you wash them to get them that white? my white pair needs help",
      "I had the same experience! I bought them out of hype as I was looking for a new shoe. \n\nAt first I thought that I was running on firm, brick of a shoe that didn\u2019t feel particularly bouncy. But they were expensive so I thought meh might as well use as much I can get out of them. To my surprise, the shoes started feeling incredible around 100 mile mark - it had poppy consistency throughout all of my long runs and I felt like I could push myself even harder last couple miles. \n\nI commented while back saying they\u2019re trash and that I prefer the Cloudmonster Hypers and I take that back 10000%. The CM Hypers (192 miles) are overpriced daily trainers at best and Superblast 2s are the do-it-all super-trainer that\u2019s worth the money. I have 356 miles on my Superblast 2s so I bought my second pair. But looks like I\u2019ll be able to use my first pair for 1,100 km!\n\nMe: new runner @ 5\u20198; 155 lbs; 20:04 5K; 45:00 10K; 1:37 HM",
      "Great review. I have two pairs of SB2\u2026one with about 600 miles and the other with 300. I also had SB1 last summer and retired them after 500 miles, perhaps too early.\n\nI use the older ones for recovery runs (4-7 miles at 8:30-9:30 min/pace) and the other for long runs (11-22 miles) that don\u2019t involve a workout. I\u2019m deep in a marathon training block running 70 mpw and these shoes are amazing for comfort and recovery. I rarely run faster than about 7:30 min/mile pace in them, but I can pick it up if desired.\n\nOther shoes in my training rotation are Evo SL, Hoka Mach X, NB 1080, and MagicSpeed 4. I still end up logging about 40% of my total weekly miles in Superblasts.",
      "I just got my superblast 2 on Friday, and immediately bought a second pair after my first run. A lot of reviewers mentioned that the foam is firm. However, mine was soft from the get go and about as soft as my old pair of Novablast 3. I find them to be Goldilock for weight, responsiveness, and softness as a daily trainer to rack up the miles. Once you hit 7:30 min/mile and below, it brought back the same joy I had with the Novablast 2 and rebel v2. \n\nI wonder if you find the shoe to be firm because it was made by different factories in different countries? I have two pairs of VF2. My baby blue pair was noticeably firmer than my other pair (Nike Run Club edition)."

    "selftext": "[Asics Novablast 5](https://preview.redd.it/pytd1r4so3te1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d80f4d6d7c4a1ea3f59d84159f70ada08bb8a0b)\n\n**Me:**\u00a027 6'2 , 180lb, midfoot/forefoot striker. HM: 1:48, Pace: around 8:30\n\nOther shoes: Brooks Glycerin 21 GTS, Asics Novablast 4 TR\n\nThis shoe has been talked about every which way to sunday so I'm not guna talk about any specs. Just my thoughts.\n\n**Some Context:**\u00a0I've been running (properly) for the last 2 years now, and I'm trying to find another pair of running shoes for myself. It's not really a surprise to me that Im getting a little too wrapped up in it, I figure whatever motivates me to keep going out and get miles is a positive thing. I'm looking to build a well rounded rotation. As I start training for my first marathon in November, I'm looking for a daily trainer that I can put the long miles on, while still having some pace. I have a shoe for some recovery mileage (Brooks Glycerin), and I have my eyes set on a shoe coming out soon for some tempo/speed work (Boston 13, hoping these tariffs don't royally screw me).\n\nCurrently, for a trainer, I have the Asics Novablast 4, TR version, which I quite like, and is what I ran my fastest half marathon in. I just would like a non \"trail\" shoe so I can feel a little more connected to the road, and doesn't have quite the aggressive grip that the TR version has. I wouldn't say they are proper trail shoes, but they are more aggressive then normal. I managed to find a pair of the normal ones in my size yesterday, It seems like the old stock of them is getting bought up.\n\n**The Shoe:**\u00a0Boy these things are soft. But soft doesn't always mean better. I immediately noticed that these things absorbed rocks/bricks/changing terrain with ease, which helps with some confidence when running on streets. As I got to the proper trail, These things really want to pick up the pace. It's obviously not a plate shoe, but they foam feels like it's actually working when you get on it. I'm not a fast runner, these seem like they would really accel at a 7-7:30 pace (or faster), I'm more of a 8-8:30 pace\u00a0*for now.*\u00a0When I tried to slow down a bit, these shoes really were not happy, I started to notice them more. And I've always thought that the best shoes are the ones you don't notice.\n\nThese things have a little like ball of foam in the center of the foot, which is supposed to act as like a \"trampoline\" like effect, It's not bothersome, but you notice it. I wouldn't say that it really propels me forward though. But I also didn't notice it as much in the 4's  \nWhen I said these things are soft, They are, but almost too much so for me, I notice that I start to pronate a little. When I start to get a little fatigued my foot starts to crash inwards a bit (pronation)  \nIt's been documented that the 4's are a little more stiff then the 5's, I have a pair of the regular 4's coming in, so I wana see if I still feel the same pronation thing, I didn't notice it before in my TR versions.\n\nI also had some issues with corners, because of the softness, I felt some ankle instability when I tried to hit some sharper corners. Which really gave me some confidence issues at some sharper turns. It's possible it's just me, I just ran the half marathon on Sunday, and then did 10 miles on Thursday, (today being Saturday) So I'm definitely not at 100%.\n\nSome other concerns I have with the 5, is that some people have already noticed that after 100 miles or so, these shoes loose their bounce. I know it's normal for a shoe to fall flat eventually, but that quickly is worrisome, and If these shoes lost their bounce I don't know if i'd reach for them tbh. I've got probably close to 100 on my 4's and I haven't noticed any life loss in them.\n\nSo where from here? As mentioned I have a pair of 4's coming in this week I'm going to try, and If I don't notice the pronation issue, I'm likely going to keep those and send these back. (crucify me for the waste I know but blame amazon for being so forgiving) , On top of that I have a pair of Superblast 2 coming in as well, I'm curious to try those out as there seems to be a love it or absolutely hate it mindset around them. My hope is that if I like those, they will become my long run shoe, and possibly the shoe I do my first marathon in.\n\nI'm hoping to get a pair of the Boston 13's when they release too, I want to try something with rods/plate, see if it helps me with some speed, and if they are comfortable enough on a long run, I might choose those for the marathon instead. I've got some time till then so I'll figure it out.\n\nAll of this has just gotten me excited to get out there and get some miles on, so I figure that can't be a bad thing at the end of it all. I'm happy to field any questions and hear any suggestions that might be there.",

      "I have 260 miles on my pair of Novablast 5 (roughly same build as you as well) and I\u2019ve gone back and forth on them. I agree with everyone that out of the box they\u2019re fun and want to go fast, but my last 50-100 miles they feel all over the place. During intervals they feel responsive but not in an energy return kind of way if that makes sense, could just be that they are compressing to where there\u2019s no more give. On easy runs they either feel completely dead or vaguely soft, but definitely nowhere near where they started. Disappointed that they fell off so quick but that\u2019s the gamble with shoes unfortunately",

For a first release shoe, this is extremely competitive and my feet are already lobbying me to give up my prior regular runners (which I\u2019d been loyal to for a decade).\n\nPros:\n* Wide Toe Box: this shoe feels good because it is actually shaped like my foot. I think the broad toe box is my favorite element of the shoe.\n* Heel Drop: I use orthotics to prevent shin splints and so I just put these into the Veloci shoe and haven\u2019t felt any undue tightness in my lower leg.\n* Cushioning: I am a plodder rather than a fast runner, but I\u2019ve felt like the ride hasn\u2019t deteriorated since I broke open the box. 200 miles and counting over 3 months of regular use.\n\nCons:\n* Heel tab: I have fat fingers so I don\u2019t really use the heel tab to put the shoes on, but the tab itself feels a bit tight when I did try it.\n* Wear and tear: I tend to scuff a particular part of the outer heel area of the outer sole. This is no different on this shoe vs previous daily runners, but I have noticed a bit of wearing down on the edge. To me, the stability is unaffected and overall cushioning still OK for my level of weekly usage.\n\nIMHO, the Veloci Ascent is a terrific shoe. I am no pro but I\u2019ve not had any sore feet or lower leg issues since starting with them. Price point at $170 is to be expected and actually pretty reasonable for a good shoe with plenty of miles to run.\n\nI\u2019ll renew my purchase. Eventually!",

      "I had a chance to try a pair of the Ascent at a demo/pop up Veloci had at our running club, and ran 2 miles as test run. For reference, I am 26M, 171lbs, about 15 miles a week, each run 3 miles, 27:57 for 5k, so not a pro runner by any means, but I do enjoy testing out shoes. \n\nWhile I did appreciate the wide toebox as advertised, that is pretty much the only good thing I have to say about this pair. There is very minimal cushion or responsiveness, the shoe looked like it had a good amount of cushion, but felt rather firm and flat once I put them on. Little support around ankle and upper as well. \n\nI started to feel some discomfort in my shins by the 1.2 mile mark, and felt a blister forming by the end of the  run. 2 days later, I felt some soreness in my knees, something I never had with my regular trainer the Novablast 5. All this from a little 2 mile run. \n\nThe Veloci staff told me that this pair was supposed to be like a Birkenstock that \"molds to your foot as your run more often\". Whether this is true can only be confirmed by those who would spend $180 to purchase them, but I think there are MUCH better options out there for that price point. (Veloci's staff confirmed price went up to $180 due to recent tariffs regulations).\n\n  \nA rather disappointing pair to me, but I understand this is Veloci's first shoe and they are still experimenting. I am excited to see what their future products hold."

I started running in the winter of 2024 and did everything, including track workouts, in a single pair of NB 1080s. My only other experience with plated shoes is 60km in my race shoes. I purchased a W10US (M8.5US) and it fits perfectly. The toebox feels narrower than average but the overall fit is snug and secure. I had no blisters or hotspots at any point. The laces are a little short.\n\nI've worn these shoes for every sort of run now: track, easy, tempo, and long run workouts. Like other people have said, the shoes are great at any pace but really shine the faster you go. When I travel I only pack the ZF6 since it can tackle any sort of road run. \n\nThe foam is responsive and the shoe feels great as my strides lengthen at faster paces. At slower paces the foam has a squishier feel and actually feels a little less stable than at faster paces, probably because I'm spending more time on my rear foot. The overall running experience is amazing, but it (obviously) lacks the lightness and bounce of a race day shoe. \n\nThe sole is pretty durable. After 300km on surfaces including gravel, packed snow and warm ice, there's barely been any wear. As you can see in the photos the little nubs on the outer heel and forefoot have worn off but everything else is intact. The design of the sole allows for mud and gravel to be easily trapped between the grooves.\n\nThe upper has no signs of functional wear; the translucent plasticky outer layer has outstanding durability and honestly feels like my norda's Dyneema upper.  I'm not sure about the longevity of ZoomX foam, but given my weight and the shoe's durability I think i could easily double and perhaps even triple my current mileage before replacing it.\n\nI haven't tried many shoes, but the ZF6 ticks all the boxes for an average runner like myself. At $225 CAD, I feel that it provides excellent value as a carbon plated, do it all supertrainer.",

    "selftext": "After half an autumn, a full winter, and a couple of weeks of spring, my Glycerin Max have reached 500km. I bought them to replace some Boston 11s which I absolutely hated, in the hopes of just eating up the long and easy miles, and maybe getting away with them on tempo runs if I could (I couldn\u2019t).\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any long-term views of these on here, so I thought I\u2019d post mine.\n\n33M, 67kg, 5:00-5:15/km easy pace.\n\nOverall: For easy and recovery runs, I\u2019ve found it to be a great shoe for me. Yes it\u2019s a bit of a chonk, but for just sitting back into easy pace and taking long runs, or shorter recovery runs it works almost perfectly. Longest run in these was 28km, and they were perfectly comfortable with no hotspots and no dead legs the next day. I could maybe see the midsole working a little better for me if I was a bit heavier, but I find it\u2019s a pretty decent balance between plush absorption and enough firmness to get some responsiveness back.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t feel like I can get any decent tempo out of these. I\u2019ve done a few long progression runs in them, and once it starts getting into the 4:20-4:30/km range they feel like a slog. For tempos, I\u2019ll usually use my Rebel V4s, although I dislike them and am desperate for them to get to a point where I can feel less guilty about binning them.\n\nIn terms of quality, these have been battered by a UK winter and have held up really well.\n\nStability and traction are spot on.\n\nAfter 500km, these still feel like they have a lot left to give. Which is great as I want to keep them in my rotation for a lot longer.\n\nUpper: Always got good comfort out of them. The tongue is well cushioned. Of course it\u2019s thick and therefore on the heavier and warmer side, but it\u2019s taken a battering from weather and still looks good. The blue staining is from putting in some kitchen paper in order to dry them out quickly after a heavy downpour run.\n\nMidsole: Does exactly what I got it for and still feels great at 500km. As mentioned above, anything at tempo I don\u2019t find that this works for me. The shoe is super stable underfoot and the rocker shaping does keep things moving.\n\nOutsole: Always had great traction, and, as can be seen, the outsole has barely worn across the 500km. Compared to my VF3s where the outsole disintegrated after about 250km. ",

      "These still look so clean, like you only ran in the treadmill lol. It gives me hope for my all white nitros I just got",
      "I have a lot of running shoes because I run a lot (80\\~90mpw) and I just like experiencing the feel and ride of different shoes that interest me (including for the trails). For the road max-stack easy/recovery/LSD category, I have the More v5, MagMax Nitro, Skyward X, and the Glycerin Max and, if I had to choose only one out of these, I'd go with Glycerin Max. \n\nThe More v5 is softer and better for really slow recovery runs, the MagMax Nitro is lighter, faster, more propulsive, and better for long runs, and Skyward X is more versatile (kinda like an overbuilt daily trainer), but the Glycerin Max, to me, is the best all-rounder for easy, recovery, long slow, and daily kinds of runs. I really like it although I'm really not a fan of how it looks. \n\nWell, it's the feel and ride that matters the most and this shoe provides a very pleasant ride at easy paces. I only have around 100 miles on mine so far and it looks and feels virtually brand new. The durability on this shoe seems to be awesome. I'm light (5'7 or 167cm and 127lbs or 57kg) so I'm not hard on the shoes to begin with. I expect to get at least 500 miles out of this shoe. I liked it so much that I got a second pair in black for the rainy days, which isn't often in SoCal where I live. Oh well, I'll be running in these for a long time to come when I just want to take it easy and cruise.",

I have a suspicion they are a tad big but not half a size worth. I haven't run in a long time, 5 + years, so I am getting back in quite gradually. So far these have been quite nice to run in. They are quite snug round the back, they go quite high, if you know what I mean, which I like. \n\nI chose these as Decathlon was the only shop within an hour of me that had running trainers for less than \u00a3120 that I could try on (Excluding Sports Direct but none in there felt right).",
      "Would the Salomon aero glide be useful as a long run daily? Currently using the superblast 2 but would love a second shoe specifically for base/easy long runs.\u00a0",
      "On Cloudsurfer - any good as an actual trainer or just a gimmick??",
      "New shoes! Salomon Aero Glide 3. Bought it just yesterday and ran right after I got it lol. Took it out on an easy daily run.\n\nMy previous 2 shoe rotation was Asics Novablast 5 and my second pair of Brooks Glycerin 21. Asics Novablast 5 got prematurely retired from running at \\~260mi due to lost bounce and was replaced by Mizuno Neo Zen. Now I need something to replace my Glycerin 21 currently at 300mi and can feel near the end of its lifespan, which hopefully this shoe is.\n\nThis shoe is REALLY similar to the Brooks Glycerin 21. The Brooks is a supercritical EVA and the Salomon is a supercritical TPU, but their bouncyness is identical. Ride is also similar; very stable and smooth, although the Glycerin very slightly edges out in that it's a bit more smoother rolling stride to me (likely due to Glycerin's slightly higher drop which I'm probably more adapted to or the brand new grippy outsole might be interfering a little bit)\n\nThe underfoot feel feels the same in both; both are on the firmer side of things (not really stiff firm--it's just not super soft like most daily trainers are nowadays) but both feel cushioned underneath. They both don't compress down much and dont rebound much either, again very similar bounce feel.\n\nTo be honest it's not as bouncy as I had hoped relative to what I've heard about, but in fairness I've only taken it out on an easy pace. I was expecting some energetic ride like the NB5/Mizuno Neo Zen, but that might've set too high of expectations. Again, Glycerin 21 is very similar in bounce in that it's quite tame in bounce on slower paces but I do feel the bounce pick up as I put down more speed. Perhaps the Salomon will perform similarly on faster paces. Anyway this will be just a strictly easy day and long run shoe for me so I don't care much for the bounce at faster paces. But I do require some bounce and smooth ride even for easy day shoe though.\n\nI measured the Salomon shoes at 248g and my Brooks shoe at 272g. But both feel the same weight to me in an actual run, at easy pace atleast.\n\nOutsole is identical in both. Both feel extremely grippy, I can noticeably feel both actively gripping the ground.\n\nWhere they start to differ is stack protectiveness. Although Salomon has higher heel stack (38mm vs 42mm), they both feel the same heel protection to me. But I can definitely feel more protective in the forefoot from the higher stack (28mm vs 34mm).\n\nBrooks has more cushioning feel lined along its upper. Not that Salomon is less comfortable though. But Brooks upper does run quite warm which was nice for the winter, but I would predict Salomon would most likely run cooler especially as we transition to Spring/Summer.\n\nOverall, Salomon Aero Glide 3 has everything I love about the Brooks Glycerin 21 and has what I would upgrade the Brooks with (higher forefoot stack and more breathable upper). My Brooks was already a perfect daily trainer, and this Salomon is a straight upgrade. My only real complaint with the Brooks was that the forefoot was not protective enough for my long runs so that's solved with this shoe. Thus the Salomon hits my needs as both the daily trainer + long run shoe, whereas the Glycerin only really fulfilled the daily trainer.\n\nThey were similar price point at original MSRP but Glycerin 21 is now discounted. if I didn't care about my long run needs and only cared purely for daily training purposes I would get Glycerin 21 just because it's now cheaper and get another shoe for long runs. Actually, that's what I might end up doing--buy my 3rd pair of Glycerin 21 for daily easy runs and use Salomon exclusively for long runs so it doesn't build up as much mileage.\n\nAnyway it's pretty much a no brainer, at least from this first run impressions, that Salomon Aero Glide 3 will most likely take Brooks Glycerin 21's spot as my new favorite daily trainer that now has the ability to protect my foot for my long runs that my Glycerin previously didn't meet. (Mizuno Neo Zen is currently my overall favorite shoe).\n\nI'm hoping though that the supercritical TPU will prove to have a longer lifespan than the Glycerin."

      "https://preview.redd.it/izzemj3n6yse1.jpeg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8180dc287c8a9ee799763efef81ab3c5e201cb88\n\nWasn't too sure about this shoe after the first run of 11 miles but, after another run of 13 miles today at tempo pace, I've come to really like it. It's definitely the softest and the bounciest midsole I've ever experienced but, somehow, it is responsive and stable at the same time.\n\nFit is TTS for me (US men's size 8), but I'm in between sizes (7.5 and 8), so the length is fine but the taper around the pinky toes can become a nuisance unless using just the right thickness socks. It took me trying three different combinations of socks before I finally found one that is comfortable.\n\nThe ride really is unlike any other shoe I've ran in. The foam is softer than foams in easy run trainers like Neo Zen, 1080v13, More v5, and Cloudsurfer, but the propulsion and energy return is indeed like that of a top-tier supershoe. The compression on the foot strikes makes me feel like I'm going slower than I really am since there isn't that snappiness I'd normally feel in plated race shoes. But, when I look at my watch, I'm going as fast as I'd be going at the same relative effort as the AF3, AP4, Cielo X1 2.0, and Sky Paris. The EE2 is right up there even though it rides and feels like a soft daily trainer.\n\nAs for the stability with this super soft foam, the platform is wide enough and the plate seems to do a good job of keeping the foot strikes centered although one still needs to focus on precise landings. I live in a very hilly neighborhood and often run fast downhill and the EE2 felt quite stable - more so than the PXSv1 and Cielo X1 2.0. Granted, I'm light at 5'7 (167cm) and 127lbs (57kg) and my landings are neutral, but I did not find stability to be an issue at all - even when going fast downhill with mainly heel strikes.\n\nThe EE2's ride is very different from that of the Cielo X1 2.0. The latter has a more exciting and propulsive character to it while the EE2's softness has more of a relaxed and bouncy ride but, the funny thing is that when I look at the stats and compare, the EE2 is just as fast and efficient. Still need to do more testing since I only have around 25 miles on each. \n\nThe EE2 is a very fun shoe. If I had to pick a race shoe for a marathon, I think it'd still be the AF3 or maybe the AP4 as I get more familiar with it. I only have around 30 miles on the AP4 and I really like it, but I'm still trying to adjust to that rocker and nail down the sweet spot. For me, it takes at least 50 miles or even more to really *get* what the shoe can do. There are so many factors and variables that come into play.\n\nI can see that the EE2 isn't for everyone and the same goes for CX1 2.0. Neither seems well suited for heavier runners or heel strikers unless they have very precise centered landings without pronation or supination. No way to tell how durable this shoe will be. The outsole seems okay but is thin and nothing like what's on the PXSv1 or most other Adizero shoes. I'd use this shoe like I have with the PXSv1/v2 for long tempo/threshold runs and workouts. \n\nThe EE2 provides a very enjoyable ride for runners who like the feel of a soft foam with a lot of bounce and energy return. It does firm up and become quite responsive when picking up the pace, but the new super foams from all brands seem to do something like that these days. There has been a lot of progress in foam technology over the last year or so.",

Foam is TPEE soft but very responsive almost identical to Adios Pro 4 TPEE midsole. Shape is like alphafly with a rigid plate. 37 heel 30 forefoot. Maybe thats the internal height because if measured from the outside its 50mm in the heel."

    "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI just returned from my first run with the Saucony Endorphin Elite 2. I feel a bit different about this shoe than a lot of the (paid) online reviews in a couple of ways. That's why I wanted to share my thoughts.\n\nSome stats: 174cm, 70kg, higher cadence running style, reasonably fast (recent 10K PB of 38:XX).\n\nCurrently searching for my shoe for a fall marathon with a sub-3 as my goal. The only other supershoe I own is the HOKA Rocket X 2, which I love, but can't picture wearing for a full marathon.\n\nUpper:\n\nI tried my usual EU size 42 in the store but immediately felt the need to go up half a size as many others do. I bought the 42,5 and get a good lockdown in it even without lace lock. There is some wrinkling of the tongue, but it doesn't matter much. The upper feels nice and airy, good stuff so far.\n\nOutsole:\n\nThe outsole got criticized by some online reviews. But in dry conditions, I found it to be pretty fucking great. The rubber is scarce, but very sticky.\n\nI haven't tried it in wet conditions, which is supposed to be its weak spot. So the jury is still out here.\n\nMidsole:\n\nThat's why you're all here for, right? And boy oh boy, is this shoe different... You all saw the videos and there's no way around it: This shoe is squishy as hell and that comes with upsides and downsides.\n\nWhen walking in it, this is the most unstable shoe I have ever worn. And it's not particularly close. Walking in it creates some drunken boxing vibes and I'm a bit worried about my ankles. But this is a running shoe, so let's run in it.\n\nMy easy pace ranges from 05:15 - 05:30 per km (08:27 - 08:46 per mile). Even at this warmup pace, the shoe instantly feels a lot more stable then when standing or walking around.\n\nAfter the warmup, I did 15 and 12 minutes of threshold (slightly above 4mins/km or 06:25 per mile) with 4 minutes of jogging in between. Needless to say that this shoe really came alive when turning it up.\n\nThe ride is like nothing I have ever tried. It feels absolutely wild. The shoe wants to keep you on your midfoot and forefoot and in general moves you forward really well.\n\nI did some strides and was pleasantly surprised how smooth the transitions were. I though that accelerating and slowing down would create some wobbling, but that was not the case.\n\nCornering is a problem. You have to slow way down to feel in control. If you plan to use it on a more difficult course, you might wanna think again. Also, anything other than a well-kept road (e.g. cobblestones) would be a no-no for this shoe.\n\nHere's my biggest gripe: I didn't seem to run efficiently. I hit my paces easily, but my HR was quite high at the end of the second rep. I usually prefer a rolling type of shoe due to my mechanics. I feel like all the bounce creates some unnecessary movement. This is 100% a personal thing, but I am sure there are other runners who feel the same.\n\nSo all in all, it's a fast shoe, it's a unique shoe. I am just not sure, if it's the right shoe for my fall marathon. Of course, this was only the first run. I will test it some more in the future.",

      "Some further thoughts:\n\n- I don't want to gatekeep, you do you of course. But with the geometry of the shoe, I wouldn't recommend this to the slower part of the pack. The slower you go, the more wobbly it gets. There's just no way around it. Even at faster paces your mechanics matter. \n\n- I really felt the plate on my right forefoot. It was a lot harsher than expected. Could have been some wrinkles in my sock, but this was not a pleasant experience.\n\n- If you like a lot of bounce in your shoes, then this is the absolute pinnacle. If you prefer shoes with a quick turnover (like I usually do), I would say there are better options out there.",
      "Thanks for the review! Considering you prefer the rolling type, are you going to try the Cielo x1 v2?",
      "Good review! I am a little slower than the times you listed but absolutely love this shoe. \n\nI think mechanics matter in this more than ever. If stability is an issue then stay far away. \n\nThe shoe reminds me of the original Prime X in terms of just tons of bounce and really wild. \n\nI\u2019ve done a number of training runs in my pair and will be taking them to a HM race this weekend.",
      "I agree with some of your thoughts but notice a few differences. \n\nAs a supinator/under pronator I was worried about the ee2\u2019s lateral cutout, but after a 5 mile workout, I understand why the cutout is there. The shoe is medially biased (for me!) even with that cutout. It works well for me and I think I land and roll through to toe-off more centrally in this shoe than any others. \n\nI also did a threshold workout (but slower at like 6:40 pace) for 2.5 miles and I could feel it in my quads which is unusual. I think because of the softness of the shoe I\u2019m going to have to build my legs up to the distance. I didn\u2019t feel sore or anything after the workout, so I don\u2019t think the extra effort was over the top. \n\nThe biggest difference though was that I didn\u2019t feel the plate at all. If you would have told me there was no plate I probably would believe it. Several reviews mentioned feeling the plate in the mid/forefoot so I was attuned and wary of it but I felt nothing. The shoe is bouncy but not snappy and feels different from other plated shoes I have run in.  You don\u2019t fall off the front of the shoe like some (spoon shaped) and it didn\u2019t have that propulsive snap like on relatively flat plates. Looking at the metrics though both my cadence and stride length increased (though that may just be my exuberance at a new pair of shoes) so for me the jury is still out on how it will work long term.",

I'm a big fan of the Norda 001 and 002 and in trail shoes from companies that specialize in trail and hiking shoes like Nnormal, The North Face, La Sportiva, VJ, etc. There's been a lot of hype for the new 005 and I knew I had to try it.\n\nTook it on a 14-mile trail run with around 2,700 ft of elevation gain over the weekend and, I have to say, it lives up to the hype as a fast, light, stable, and very comfortable trail shoe. As many reviewers have pointed out, I'm not so convinced by the outsole which is supposed to be the latest-and-greatest from Vibram, but the midsole does feel like something special in terms of bounce, propulsion, comfort, responsiveness, and protection without the assistance of a plate of any sort. The upper is also more pliable and comfortable right out of the box than what I've experienced with the 001 and 002.\n\nIt's hard to say if it's faster and more propulsive than plated shoes like the Tecton X 3, Agravic Speed Ultra, and TNF Vectiv Pro 2, but it's lighter and more nimble than those shoes with better ground feel and stability. Obviously, it's not quite as cushioned as those shoes with fairly high stack height, but the comfort was excellent over the 14 miles. I'd need to go on a 25\\~30-mile run to get an idea of how it'd handle ultra distances. It's probably not the best choice for 100 miles although I know I'll never try to run such an ultra.\n\nIt's a very fun shoe and it really is nice to have something so light and nimble for the trails while getting good protection as well as nice ground feel. The Kjerag is even lighter, but I find it hard to go over 10 miles with that shoe due to how low it is to the ground. It's expensive, but if the durability is as good on this as it is on the 001,  it will be worth it in the end. 001 owners regularly get 700\\~1,000+ miles, so if this can get to 650 good miles, it'll have been worth the investment. Just really hard to say how long this new outsole will last and how well the midsole will hold up."

Ran on roads and a small amount of dirt trail.\n\n**Weather ran in:**\n\nDry and rainy conditions\n\n**My profile:**\n\nHeight: 6\u20190\u201d\n\nWeight: 160lbs\n\nWeekly mileage: 70 miles (\\~112km). 1:24 HM and 2:57 FM\n\nStrike Type: Shufflle-y midfoot striker\n\n**Positives:**\n\n* Fits true to size\n* Easy to get a secure lockdown\n* Comfortable upper\n* Responsive midsole\n* Stable platform even when taking sharp turns\n* Excellent wet weather grip\n\n**Negatives:**\n\n* Stained my socks purple \n\n**Overview:**\n\nCurrently training for Boston with a 3-shoe rotation: Superblast 1, Puma Deviate Nitro 2 and Alphafly 3. I plan to use the AF3 for the marathon, but they have 250 miles on them, so I needed a workout shoe for the remaining weeks leading up to race day.\n\nThe Puma Deviate Nitro Elite 3 had been on my radar for a few months, but I was waiting for a version in my size that didn't have the words \"Nitro\" blasted across the upper. And these purple ones fit the bill, as they reminded me of a pair of lilac Adios Pro 3's I took to over 400 miles. On my first run in the DNE3, the midsole's responsiveness was eerily similar to what I experienced in the AP3 -- though with a far more comfortable upper -- and cutting down to marathon pace felt effortless. \n\nMy second run in them was a 20-mile day that included pacing a half marathon on a hilly course on a wet and very windy morning. Whether I was running through puddles, sandy bike path, muddy patches or taking sharp turns, I felt sure-footed throughout. On my cooldown, I picked up the pace and they were a delight at marathon effort. My only gripe so far is, when I took them off, they had stained my socks purple. \n\n**Worth buying?:**\n\nYes. Looking forward to putting more miles in these and using them for a marathon this summer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ylakrgdb6wre1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14dba28ab7e70640efb275d60d934b32ac56b3ed\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fnp9746c6wre1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8eeedf00e48917f6ba2f156d885b7e2e31d83999\n\n  \n",

    "title": "Superblast 2 @365 Miles",
    "selftext": "**Shoe Model & Size:**\u00a0ASICS Superblast 2 in a size 10.5\n\nFor context I am a 6'0\" tall runner who weighs 155 pounds. I am a forefoot/midfoot striker who tends to supinate as you can tell from my wear pattern. I am currently averaging about 40MPW and my race times are:\n\n* 5K: 18:55\n* HM: 1:37\n* Marathon: 3:28\n\nI am a bit of a running shoe nerd who has also tried a lot of different shoes and am ramping up for race season 2025.\n\nBefore I get into the review,\u00a0**here are other shoes I have tried**:\n\n* Shoes I like: Triumph 21, Novablast 5, Evo SL, Endorphin Speed 4, Alphafly 3\n* Shoes I'm meh (not my favorite but the note worst): Novablast 4, 1080v14, Nike Tempo, New Balance SC Elite v4\n* Shoes I hate: On CloudMonster Hyper, Nike Invincible 3, Endorphin Speed 3, Endorphin Pro 4\n\n**How I used these:**\u00a0I did literally everything in this shoe except racing and track work. These have been a workhorse daily for me accumulating almost all of my mileage post NYC marathon and during my build back from some IT Band Injury. I did long runs (up to 15 miles), workouts, easy miles, and everyday runs in these.\n\nThese might be my favorite shoe of all time\n\n**Sizing:**\u00a0Go TTS, that's it, that's the headline\n\n**Upper:**\u00a0Super comfy woven upper, most of my work done in these was in winter and I found them breathable but also quite cozy. The inside of the upper is very well padded and it has a plush step-in feel that makes your foot feel locked down and secure\n\n**Tongue and Laces:**\u00a0The tongue is pretty thin and is one of the elements that pulls from race shoe heritage. It has a bit of cushion where you tie your laces which is great for alleviating pressure on the top of your ankle. The lacing system itself is simple, no nonsense, and I had no trouble getting a lockdown\n\n**Midsole:**\u00a0This is where the magic happens. The hefty slab of FF Turbo+ race foam makes for a fun ride. It feels great at easy paces but comes to life at marathon and half marathon paces. The second foam under the FF Turbo+ adds a lot of durability to the shoe. The foam feels very light and airy albeit firm. They definitely got softer over time but offered insane energy return for a non-plated shoe. I also felt like the amount of midsole in these did a great job of protecting the legs which is useful in higher mileage sections of your training block.\n\n**Outsole:**\u00a0Out of the NB4, NB5, and SB2, the Superblast 2 has the best outsole of any Asics shoe that I have tried so far. It is quite grippy and I never had issues with traction (even while running throughout a cold and icy Chicago winter). There is a good amount of wear on the lateral side as you can see in how smoothed out that is in the picture. This pretty common with my supination.\n\n**Durability:**\u00a0I think the durability and quality of this shoe supports the price point. While expensive for a non-plated shoe, I think its worth because of the amazing ride, versatility, and quality of materials. While I could take these to 400 miles, I am probably not going to as I can till the foam is starting to bottom out for me in the forefoot causing some ankle pain. I think a lot of runners could take them to 400-450 miles, I just wear out my shoes a lot quicker than others because I land pretty hard.\n\nIn terms of cosmetics, they look great aside from dirt on the upper. The foam has less creasing than I expected and the outsoles are good too except for the lateral edges I pointed out and some cracking in the foam.  \nAlso worth calling out that this is the only shoe I have bought two pairs of. I have a second pair on ice that I will busting out this Summer for my Chicago Marathon training block. Currently working through the EVO SLs, Novablast 5s, and using my Alphafly 3's for workouts.\n\nGoing to give these a 10/10. I hope ASICS doesn't change much in these. Might have to keep my eyes peeled for a 3rd pair just in case. Worth the hype - I'd recommend these to anyone.",

      "good writeup.\u00a0 Just did my weekly long run in SB2 - for me it's the soles of my feet that really appreciate them...just no soreness at all.\n\n\nI hate the way they sound - slap, slap - but I still love them!",
      "Man I\u2019ve got 900k on mine after my last training block and they\u2019re still going strong! Though they\u2019ll be retired shortly once my new ones arrive",
      "One thing I love about these is how easy it is to lock into a pace and hold it for hours on out. Back when I first got them, I would of ten times be surprised at how fast I was going for my perceived effort after spending some time without checking my watch. \n\nAnother thing I really like about them is that both Superblast and Evo SL are the exception to the rule that there is a tradeoff between smooth transition and midsole pop/responsiveness. Those are special shoes where you can get plenty of both. The rocker geometry and the foam just comes so well together providing the best of both worlds. I\u2019m a big fan of the trampoline on the ball of the foot. I thought I liked it on the Novablast 5, but on the Superblast I like it even better. Because the foam is so resilient, it doesn\u2019t bottom out during a long run and continues protecting my feet and pushing me forward when I get to double digit long run mileage territory. \n\nThey are also my favorite shoes ever, though the Evo SL is getting really close to being up there. However, when my knee gave me a little niggle after a demanding last week, I decided to exclusively run with the Superblast this week and it payed off. I had a 10k race on Sunday so I front loaded my week to give me two rest days before my race, which I ended up setting a 10k PR. I also set a half marathon PR the Sunday before that. In hindsight, I should\u2019ve just replaced my Sunday run with the race and have a lighter week. But anyways, Superblast came in clutch this week and perhaps I might finish the week setting another Half Marathon PR.\n\nEdit: Already have another pair, since I\u2019m ranking the miles pretty quickly and am planning on running my first full marathon next year. Even if I don\u2019t race in these, they\u2019ll definitely be a big part of the training to get me there.",

Did a 10-miler the day before with the AP4 and I think I like the CX1 2.0 more. Still familiarizing myself with the AP4 after 30 miles, but I got on with the CX1 2.0 almost immediately. Maybe it's the rocker point and the geometry as well as the midsole characteristics, but the CX1 2.0 just feels smoother and fits my gait cycle better. Have the AF3 and Sky Paris as well and they are all top-tier, but this shoe just seems to have something that fits my mechanics better.\n\nThe weight of 6.8oz (193g) at my US men's size 8 is awesome, on par with the AP4, a little lighter than the AF3 and almost 1.5oz (43g) lighter than the CX1, which is also a shoe I like very much. Obviously, there are similarities between 2.0 and the OG but, overall, they are very different shoes. The 2.0 is now a top-tier racer while the OG, to me, is more of a long-distance trainer like the PXS v1/v2.\n\nThe heel is very narrow in the vein of something like the PXSv1, so it's not a stable shoe - especially if one's a heel striker. I have thousands of miles on multiple pairs of PXSv1 and haven't had stability issues although I do have to be more mindful about obstacles and how I land. Like the PXSv1, the CX1 2.0 can feel unstable going fast downhill, but running on flat terrains and going uphill feels and rides great. It's the most enjoyable ride out-of-the-box that I've experienced in a long while and I go through a lot of shoes.\n\nOnly one run, so I can't say it's the \"best\" or my favorite just yet. Still need to try the Endorphin Elite 2 which I received along with the CX1 2.0. For me, it takes around 50 miles minimum to really get a good idea of what a new shoe is like and come to some sort of a \"verdict\", so I'll see how it shakes out but, based on this first run, I think this shoe will become a mainstay and one of my few faves. It has such a nice balance between bouncy propulsion and smooth rollover. I would not recommend this shoe to heel strikers as it really is unstable at the heel. It's wobbly just standing in this shoe and very awkward walking in it. It's meant for running fast but feels great at moderate paces as well (not so good at slow)."

    "selftext": "Sizing: TTS\n\nLong and short of this is: The Vaporfly is back for me. The VF3 lost a bit of the crazy speed and connectedness in exchange for more comfort. The 4 is back to being a lightning rod that you grab onto and enjoy the ride.\n\nStarting with the upper, it is slightly more dialed in than the VF3, less baggy over the toes but still highly comfortable. The mesh is lightweight and breathes well, but does not feel brittle despite how light this shoe is. There is still the familiar heel cushion in the back of this shoe that I loved in the VF1-3.\n\nThe midsole and ride are where this gets exciting. I have not used the Adios Pro Evo 1, so this is by far the lightest super shoe I have ever felt. The weight is almost imperceptible on foot. Nike has also cut down the stack height from 40/32, to 35/29. So a 6mm drop instead of 8mm. People seemed alarmed when this news came out, but I would remind everyone that the original Vaporfly stack was 33/23. There is not a cushioning deficit here for almost any type of run. \n\nThe updated plate/geometry in the 4 and incredible light weight means this thing flies. Absolutely ripped through the middle section of my 6 mile initial workout. I turned in some of the fastest mile intervals I\u2019ve done in months in this shoe and it begged for more. Turnover is incredibly easy, accompanied by a strong pop from the foam and plate. Even my \u201ccooldown\u201d mile was far faster than my usual cooldown pace. I would easily use this up to a half marathon as I feel it is slightly more stable than the VF3 and cushioned enough. They have differentiated this successfully from the AF3 now as well.\n\nOutsole has switched back to a similar layout from the VF1/2, but a bit grippier lugs in the front. No complaints here, it just works. Very very impressed so far and this will be my go to for some upcoming shorter races",

      "As OP mentions and other reviews have as well, Nike is now positioning the Alphafly as its full marathon shoe and the Vaporfly for shorter, faster distances. The California cross country kids who have long been using them for their 5K firetrail races as well as parkrunners around the world have been vindicated.",

      "First impression with streakfly 2:\n\nBackground- returning from a substantial hip flexor injury picked up in august during marathon training. Finally able to restart running at all in late january with the plan to start speed work this month. Serendipitously, the streakfly 2 proto released and i got lucky\n\nI say to note that there may be a good amount of bias built in causing ive been itching to go fast but my god did i feel fast. With supershoes, im used to the carbon response but have also grown used to how much the cushion plays a role. The cushion is there but the response is FUN. \n\nEffortless roll with the strike that feels natural, amazing snap back through the stride. Propulsion exceeding the other supershoes. I was trying not to push too hard (a usual speed stride pace around 5min but i was aiming for 5:30) and i felt like i needed to physically pull myself out of the forward lean so as not to hit that speed. \n\nIm in no way my best shape and those sprint efforts (albeit only 30sec-1 min) never showed up dramatically in hr change. It simply felt easier to be at speed. \n\nI plan on incorporating more 5k/10k races into my marathon prep this year so these shoes made sense to me. To be frank, if youre looking to use for speed session/ training, i would actually avoid. There will be a clear difference in perceived effort in the streakfly2 and any nike marathon supershoe. \n\nFeel free to ama on details of the shoe if interested",
      "In an attempt to make my AlphaFly 3s not be blister machines I tore out the insoles and put in some larger ones, and I also noticed that there is a small hole above the last eyelet that I was able to enlarge and set the shoe up with a proper runners loop. \n\nAm I the first person to do a runners knot on a AF3? Anyone else do this?",
      "Would Pegasus Premium be worth it if I had a 40% discount",
      "Nike runners just never fit me right. Clothing yes",
      "The Streakfly 2 release was fudged terribly by Nike. They promoted the release for a week (after making Europe and UK wait a further 31 days after their March 1st global release date) with the Proto colourway discounted by \u20ac10 saying 8am release on April 3rd. \n\nI was on from 7.55am on 3 devices and when 8am came Nike's website and app immediately said no sizes available in anything above 6.5uk. Coincidentally, these lower sizes were available on the US site since release so it looks like Nike gave a 'release' date in Europe and UK with no sizes actually available (above 6.5) as their stock was already sold in other countries when it was released there. If someone managed to get a Streakfly 2 in a 8uk/43, 9uk/EU44 or 10uk/45 - please let us know here..... feeling let down by questionable advertising."

    "selftext": "Since the Ride 18 is now available, this is for those trying to make a decision on whether it\u2019s worth buying a discounted pair of 17s.\n\nMale runner, 5\u201910\u201d, 180 lbs, 20-25mpw, heel striker. I run for fun not performance so I don\u2019t have identified 5k/10k/HM paces but I\u2019m generally running 7-10 miles with a pace in the range of 7:30-8:20 min/mile. Haven\u2019t pushed further on distance because I\u2019m a middle aged guy trying to build back up slowly after injury, no doubt that these shoes will hold up well on longer distances. Rotate Ride 17 as road daily with ES2 for road tempo and Endorphin Edge for trail.\n\nThis shoe was my return to Saucony after a foray through On and Hoka. Left On for all the normal reasons, Hoka because I got tired of running on marshmallows. Shoes felt great from the beginning and improved with some break in. Firmer but not too firm. Adapts well to different paces from slow to moderate to low end tempo, though won\u2019t push to the paces I can get with ES2. In the best way, it\u2019s a shoe I don\u2019t notice - though not the lightest it doesn\u2019t feel heavy; neither slowing me down or speeding me up; I never finish a run with my feet hurting or my legs sore from the shoe.\n\nUpper not the most breathable but also didn\u2019t feel hot to me; then again my feet tend to not feel hot in shoes anyway for some reason. Great in cold weather; I can definitely feel the cold in my ES2s but not these.\n\nI bought a half size too large which gave me some lockdown issues, which caused the rubbing you\u2019ll see the top of the heel, especially on my left foot (half size shorter than right). Improved once I got a better lockdown. Outside of that, upper has always been comfortable, no hotspots or blisters or other issues.\n\nWet traction isn\u2019t great - feels a tad slippy but has never caused an injury or fall. Moreso just feel the lack of traction and lose a few seconds off my pace.\n\nAlready have another pair ready to replace these (though in the right size), but may be a while. I\u2019ve never had a shoe feel this awesome at 400 miles and expect another 100+ miles in them. Recommend as a great stable neutral daily trainer to affordably eat up miles in comfort. They may not pop like Novablasts (while the pop lasts) or fly like Evo SL (if you can handle the Evo SL\u2019s instability), but are a great jack of all trades. Can\u2019t match the combination or comfortable upper + TPU foam + durability at this price point.",

      "from a data visualization perspective, I would strongly recommend you try to find a way to show both values in the same orientation, in other words, \"high = good\" for both, or \"low = good\" for both. You could do this by graphing energy lost versus shock absorption, instead of energy return (low = better for both), or by graphing energy return versus 100 - your current shock absorption (high = better for both).\n\nHaving the two bars share the same \"meaning\" in terms of orientation will make the chart much easier for people to understand. \n\nAlternatively, graph the bars which should be shorter when they are good upside down, from the top of the graph, reaching downwards, whereas the bars which should be longer (taller = good) upwards, from the bottom of the graph.",

Adios pro 3, Cielo x1, Novablast 5, puma magmax, HOKA Bondi 9 \n\nAware this shoe has been reviewed to death but thought would give my view on it for anyone considering it at the moment. \n\nHow I have used it: original purchased for a road ultra marathon but quickly figured out it wasn\u2019t for that (more on that later). Generally using for distances between 10 - 30km with paces ranging from 3:30 to 4:45 (km per min). So have used it as more a speed shoe or uptempo shoe. I did also do a 3:08 marathon in them as part of the testing for an ultra shoe so have put some decent miles into them. \n\nFit: very comfortable upper and fits me tts. Maybe slightly long but would go tts. There is a bit of an aggressive \u201ctaper\u201d (if that the right word) at the front of your shoe by your small toes so had a little bit of rubbing there but wasn\u2019t an issue after the first run or two. For reference though I have a pretty narrow foot so could see that being a potential issue for wider foot individuals. \n\nRide: if I had to sum it up it in a sentence it would be \u201cmid amount of cushion, but a firmer shoe that prefers quicker speeds\u201d. I saw some reviews talking about how it is nice and cushioned while having a good bounce, but this wasn\u2019t my experience in them. To me it gave you quite a planted feeling to the ground, while being fairly firm and stiff. When you cruising at around 5 pace and under its work well but found anything around 5:30-6 (km pace) just a little flat and uncomfortable. \nI also see it be suggested quite often as an affordable (not really) marathon race option. But for the previously mentioned race I ran I have never gotten to the end of a race with my legs feeling so beat up, by the end felt I was almost running barefoot and was getting nothing out of the shoes. So would rather get a discounted pair of carbon race shoes which will probably be cheaper anyway.\n\nAware it all sounds negative but they certainly work at certain areas. Speed or harder efforts up to 20/25km I think they do well especially when you pushing closer to that 4-4:30 pace. Also a bit more specific to me but have enjoyed them for my track workout as always feel a little unstable in my race shoes going around those bends so me it has worked great on a track cause of how planted I feel in them.\nBut if you wanting a great long run/marathon shoe I would look at something else. \n\nDurability: been decent. Starting to see some scuff marks on the non protected areas of the soles which doesn\u2019t really happen this soon for me but otherwise been fine. \nTo the durability the sole is fine but find it very slippery in the wet so would be careful using it in wet conditions. \n\nSummary: for the price you pay for these I would give it a miss. They decent shoes but not \u00a3175 shoes. Especially when you starting to see some super shoes close to that. \nBut if you wanting a tempo or speed shoe in your rotation and prefer the firmer/closer to the ground feeling then think these are a good option to consider. \nBut if you wanting a do it all shoe I would probably suggest something else. \n\nHappy to answer any questions. \n",

      "Man, I'm always amazed by how fresh the outsoles look on these long term reviews. I'm a heavier runner and most of my shoes' outsoles start getting wear around 100K and by 300K, they're useless for running in wetter weather. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong lol",
      "Retail price is definitely too much for them. I got the speed 3 just before the speed 4 came out on sale at \u20ac140. At this price I thought they\u2019re ok. I wore them out pretty hard as I used them for intervals and tempo runs. \n\nTowards the end I used them as a daily trainer and gave up on them at 600km.

    "title": "Atreyu Daily Trainer 2 - Worth it? - Initial Review",
    "selftext": "Atreyu has stepped up the their price point on this one which has gotten some mixed feedback. I for one have zero regret giving them more than I'm used to for these, and I hope people don't sleep on them.\n\nAfter a few runs at a range of paces (5:30/mi strides to 11/mi recovery run, low to high zone 2 and hour tempo run), and a good bit of experience with most of Atreyu's current lineup of shoes, I can pretty confidently say that this is not only the best, most versatile and best looking shoe Atreyu has released, they've also achieved what the prior versions of the Daily Trainer did not. Namely, they've grabbed the best features of their (truly beloved to many) Base model and (major value buy for a carbon plated supertrainer->race shoe) Race model, for a shoe you can use most days (maybe even truly daily for a lot of folks).\n\nYou get almost, but not quite as much lightness and ground feel responsiveness as the Base\u2026 but you make up for it clearly in durability and a fun bouncier ride with a lot more energy return. And you don\u2019t get quite as much pick up and top speed efficiency as the Race\u2026 but you make up for it in a more stable shoe at a wider range of speeds, and a peppy feel in the outsole that is still close to a plated shoe (probably due to the lower stack and superfoam combo) so you can still turn it up in when you want to. It's not 100% Pebax, but if you haven't tried Atreyu's supercritical EVA (which Pebax is mixed with in the DT 2), it's really quite nice even on its own.\n\nAesthetically, it\u2019s definitely the sharpest looking shoe Atreyu has made, and it is clearly built to last. Only gripe is the shoelaces (seem to be same as the Race model for those that have them). I can't seem to get a good tie with them where I want it and they are hard to double knot. Was hoping for something a little more premium there, but you can't have it all. Like the Base, the upper fits me perfectly with zero heel slippage, so even without getting a secure tie exactly where I want it to be, I\u2019m not in a rush to change them, but I still probably will. Not sure if I\u2019ll go with lock laces (may because I\u2019d like to take them on some longer runs where I sometimes need to loosen on the fly) or just plain white cotton laces like the Base model comes with so I can also wear them casually. Super comfortable walking shoe as well.\n\nI set them immediately to my default road shoe on Strava (lately I've been bouncing between the Topo Specter 2 and Cyclone 2 fairly evenly). I'll still use the Cyclone from time to time, but I don't think I'll use the Specter 2 as much now that I have these. Size-wise - I went with a 10 which is a half size up from TTS for me and same as all Atreyus. In the future, I'll probably go up a full size for the Race and Base Trail models, but these fit me just like the Base model, perfect a half size up.",

      "Man I just find it difficult to want to spend $170 on the shoe. Especially when Atreyu's price point started in the mid $70 to $80 range.\n\nI used to blow through their shoes, so I don't doubt that the quality is a major improvement over what they used to offer, but a 35% jump from the Daily Trainer is a hard sell for me.\n\nMore expensive than a Nike Vomero or an Asics Gel Nimbus, which is crazy.",

    "selftext": "About me: 1.75m, 72kg. 5km in 35min, 10km in 55min. I started running in June 2023.\n\nRecently, I bought a pair of Olympikus Corre Max (size 40 BR) for R$499.00 ($87.00 USD). I've only done one 5k run with them so far.\n\nThe Positives\n\n\u2705 Comfort \u2013 The Olympikus Corre Max is the softest shoe I've ever had, it feels like putting my foot into a very soft cushion. Everything is well-padded, and my feet feel great after a walk, and I had no pain at all. The fit is true to size, with plenty of space in the forefoot, especially in the toe box. It\u2019s also wide on the sides, like most Olympikus models.\n\n\u2705 Cushioning and running experience \u2013 The Olympikus Corre Max is extremely soft, possibly the softest shoe I've ever tried (compared to my Asics Gel Nimbus 26 and Mizuno Victory). However, it\u2019s not too soft to the point of feeling unstable because it still maintains a good energy return. Running in them feels smooth and effortless. It's probably not the best option for speed or tempo training, as its weight and lack of energy return work against it (the outsole is firm, but the EVA-based midsole slightly counteracts that). But for easy runs, it's perfect. The Mizuno Victory is much firmer and offers better energy return due to its seemingly harder outsole, but I still prefer the Olympikus Corre Max.\n\n\u2705 Ventilation \u2013 Despite the plush cushioning, the shoe remains breathable, which should be great for spring/summer. Even in higher temperatures, I believe it will stay cool and comfortable on my feet.\n\nThe Negative\n\n\u274c Energy Return \u2013 As mentioned before, I think the shoe could benefit from a slightly firmer outsole to make it more responsive, cause it lacks a bit of \"explosion\" I imagine that its more premium version, with a graphene sole (Corre 3 Grafeno), might be able to fix this.\n\nConclusion\n\nSo far, I've really enjoyed the Olympikus Corre Max. The comfort and softness are its biggest highlights, better than any other shoe I've tried. It's an excellent shoe for easy and long runs. I have a feeling that its premium versions could be even better.",

At the moment, most weekly runs are as follows: Mon: Z3/4 Threshold Run (10k) in Puma Deviate Nitro Elite 1 (purchased for $120USD); Wed: Z2 Convo pace (17k) in Craft Nordlite Ultra (purchased for $74USD); Thur: Track infield drills and striders (4-5k) in Nike Dragonfly XC (usually with spikes removed & purchased for $79USD); Sat: Z2/Z3 long run (25-30k) in New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Elite v4 (purchased for $200USD).\n\nAs you can see, I try to find deals on my shoes. I don't mind getting last year's model. Usually I wait until they are at least 40-50% off before pulling the trigger. Even the New Balance FuelCell SuperComp Elite v4 were purchased at a 20% discount directly from the New Balance website.\n\nAs a heavier runner (85kg), I'm hard on midsoles (compression). My IT Band's general rule of thumb is to get...200k on racing shoes; 300k on trainers and trail shoes; and 400k on the most durable daily trainers."

    "title": "Mizuno Wave Rebellion Pro 2 aka the Mizuno RebellionFly -Next%. Bonus comparison to Adidas Prime X Strung.",
    "selftext": "I know this is a review of some old has been shoes, but maybe someone will find it interesting, given the Wave Rebellion Pro 2's are now on some pretty big clearance sales.\n\nBackground:\n\n51M, 5'9\", 174 lbs.  Run about 35 to 55 mpw, depending on season.  Daily running pace is \\~ 9 min / miles @ \\~ 135 bpm.  Size 10.5 ft width D.  I usually size up to 11 in shoes.\n\nGear:\n\nI run with a Garmin 645M, Stryd (half the time), Polar chest strap HRM (most of the time).\n\nCurrent Rotating shoes:\n\nAsics Novablast 3, Superblast 1, Mizuno Wave Sky 7, Nike Vaporfly Next%, Nike AF1, Adidas Prime X Strung.  Most of these shoes are either EOL, or halfway there.  PXS is toast at 800 miles now, but I just swapped in my last brand new pair.\n\nSo, now that I'm on the last pair of my favorite shoe of all time (Prime X Strung), I figured I should start looking at other super trainer type shoes.  Some shoes that were up for consideration: Hoka Cielo X1, and the Wave Rebellion Pro 2.  I already tried the Prime X Strung 2 a year ago, and I had to send them back.  They were absolutely horrible.  The Wave Rebellion Pro 2 looked intriguing, and they were on a big sale.  I got them for $134 before tax.  I'm not a big fan of Mizuno, and have another pair of their dailies that I loathe.  Prior to that, the last Mizuno I ran in was over 20 years ago.  But, I was willing to give Mizuno another chance.  I've ran in them these past three days, and put 15 miles on them.  I did back to back testing with these shoes and my last brand new pair of PXS.  Here are some initial thoughts:\n\n1. Fit: I got these in a size 11, and damn, they fit SMALL.  The toe box is really narrow and cramped.  I would return these just because of the size.  Size 11 in the Adidas Prime X Strung is awesome.  I have so much room in the toe box, that my feet swim in it.  If you size up by half for your running shoes, you might want to size up a full size for these.  Especially with the weird geometry of the midsole, my feet keeps sliding into the toe box area more, and my toes feel like they're getting jammed the hell up.\n2. Weight: These are some fairly light shoes.  I weighed them at 8.6 oz's.  Surprisingly, there is a pretty big difference in weight between both sides of about 0.25 oz's.  My Adidas PXS weighs a full oz+ more at 9.8 oz.  Also surprising that the PXS also has a difference in weight between both sides of about 0.2 oz's.\n3. Midsole: The midsole is honestly magical.  I have the Mizuno Wave Sky 7 that has a big stack height of 41 mm and their new Enerzy midsole.  I absolutely hated that shoe.  I got it because I'm on Amazon Vine, and it was offered to me for free.  I haven't ran in a Mizuno since over 20 years ago, but the new midsole and hype got me excited to run in a Mizuno again.  But, that hype was quickly popped after I ran in the shoe.  The midsole was hard and FIRM, and it was just a heavy, clunky shoe.  Just despise it and can't wait to hit 400 miles so I can toss the shoes. With the Wave Rebellion Pro 2, the midsole feels super bouncy and energetic.  I hate using the term responsive, because to me, that just means FIRM and HARD as hell.  I like midsoles that are BOUNCY (think Nike Invincible Run midsole).  And, the Wave Rebellion Pro 2 BOUNCES like trampolines.  I actually think it's bouncier than the Alphafly and even the Prime X Strung, especially with that weird geometry.\n4. Outsole: It's fine, not much else to say about it.\n5. Upper: Very thin, breathable, and light.  I love the upper.  It's a synthetic engineered structured fabric that is different than anything else in my rotating shoes.\n6. Geometry: Very odd.  The drop isn't the issue, but that significant rocker just makes this shoe really difficult for me to run in.  As a mid foot striker, I end up landing right on the rocker like it's a fulcrum, which makes the trampoline effect more pronounced.  It really feels like you're landing on the tip of a soft triangle.  The triangle compresses and pops you right back up.  This sounds great in theory, but for me, it starts to fatigue my foot arch quickly.  I start to run in a way that actively avoids this, and try to land more on the forefoot.  But, because the geometry of the shoe is so weird in the forefoot (not a lot of drop), the shoe teeters back on that triangle part of the shoe to the heel.  This really fatigues my quads.\n\nFirst run was a SLOW 5 miler with my wife.  We jogged 10:30 min / miles, and that whole time, I was thinking, \"Damn, these are a slog to run in.\"  My legs, calves and quads, felt pretty beat from that jog.  I wasn't sure why.  But, I figured on Sat. I would do a back to back 5 miler with this shoe against my newly opened Prime X Strung.\n\nSecond run was this past Sat.  I did the first 5 miles in the Mizunos.  I warmed up one mile, and then ran 2 miles out and 2 miles back.  Timed the distance and checked the average HR.  I did the same run in the Adidas after resting, hydrating, and eating some dry cereal.  Started the 2 miles out and back at the around the same HR as the Mizunos.  The Mizunos felt like a chore to run.  It was fatiguing my legs a bit.  The Adidas were great in comparison.  Legs felt much better, but I think they were fatigued from the Mizunos, so it wasn't the best run.  I ran the distance around the same time, and checked my average HR.  Surprisingly, it was around the same.  So, I figured I would give it another go today and start with the Adidas first.\n\nYesterday, did the same run.  Warmed up a mile, then ran 2 mile out and back.  Damn, the Adidas felt awesome.  I just started picking up the pace and was down to 7:30 min / miles.  On the way back, I was around 7 to 7:30 min miles as the slight head wind turned to a tail wind.  Legs felt awesome.  Then I hydrated, rested, cooled off (warm day in the upper 70's), and had some dry cereal.  Went back in the Mizunos, and even the 1 mile warm up was a slog.  Doing the next 4 and it was HARD to hit the same time as the Adidas.  My legs felt SO fatigued, I almost wanted to stop and walk for a bit, but I soldered on and finished a bit over the time of the Adidas.  I checked my average HR and it was 157 bpm vs 150 bpm for the Adidas.  It sure felt like it.  I have now christened this shoe as the new NEGATIVE Next%, because it feels like it's sapping energy instead of giving it back.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThese shoes are going back.  I'm returning them, like I did the Adidas Prime X Strung 2's.  It would have been a great shoe, I think, if it wasn't for the weird geometry of the mid sole.  I love the midsole material, and the upper and how light the shoe is, but they need to get rid of that aggressive rocker.  I think the new Wave Rebellion Pro 3 has much better geometry, and I wouldn't mind checking out that shoe sometime.  But, right now, I think I just have to hope that the Prime X Strung 3 re-captures the magic of the OG shoe.\n\n",

      "I wore these for a half marathon last year and I can totally see where you're coming from. They really put a strain on my calf muscles like no other shoe and cornering was something to be avoided at all costs.

A really cool experiment but certainly needs some tinkering before it works.",

    "selftext": "Sizing: TTS, a touch snug around the toes, some may want to go a half size up.\n\nTook these out for a first 8 mile spin yesterday, I was a bit dubious given how soft they felt but read that the energy return is top notch and decided to trust in that assessment. \n\nFirst off, the upper is amazing in these. Probably the most comfortable upper of any super shoe. The heel collar is especially plush and it is easy to achieve a very controlled lockdown, which for a shoe this soft is very important. I did notice the toebox tapering in a bit near the pinky toe, it wasn\u2019t an issue on the run but some may want to size up slightly to avoid any possible issue there.\n\nNow onto the midsole and ride. The Elite 1\u2019s midsole is one of my favorite ever for how stable it is and how much pop it has. Reading about the 2 and how squishy it was, gave me some apprehension. After getting on well enough with the Adios Pro 4, another squishy midsole, I decided to take the plunge here. All I can say is this is the most absurdly soft material I have ever felt. When walking, you can feel the shoe deform as it squishes almost to the pavement with each step. Once I started running though, the squish was accompanied by a rebound I have never felt, this is the bounciest midsole I have ever tried. \n\nAt half marathon and 10k pace the midsole firmed up slightly and delivered amazing return. It felt pretty much on par with the return in the Elite 1, but obviously differs drastically in how it delivers that bounce. The 1 has a snappy poppy responsive feeling when paired with an aggressive rocker that keeps you turning over. The 2 has a booming bounce and a similar rolling sensation up front. Amazingly, for how soft the midsole is, I don\u2019t have any soreness around my ankles today, suggesting it has decent stability on the run despite being so soft. I would still not recommend this for anyone with stability issues as such a soft foam creates challenges in that department. Is it better than Elite 1? Tough to say\u2026it is very different and may work better for some.\n\nThe outsole is much much grippier than version 1 and feels confidence inspiring. The only downside is I am seeing a bit of wear on the exposed foam just because the shape of the midsole deforms so much when striking the ground. Durability is not likely to be great here. \n\nBottom line, this is a very fun ride, and it legitimately feels different than anything I\u2019ve ever run in before. Even if it does not work for everyone, Saucony deserves kudos for trying something new. A lot of super shoes feel similar nowadays and this is a completely different experience that I\u2019d recommend people consider if it fits their needs",

      "Huge AF1 guy here. This shoe is like 95% as good when my form is on point, but once it breaks down, it is substantially better than the AF. Gonna use it for my next marathon. The alphafly punishes my arrogant pacing and subsequent slow downs.\u00a0",

I've done three marathons in my Endorphin Pro 3s and am considering doing another this Spring instead of replacing them as a race-day shoe. \n\nHeard good things about this one but the cost to durability has me thinking it may not be worth it for me. Also considering the Metaspeeds after demo'ing the Edge last week, but I'm not sure how durable they are either.\n\nEDIT: These shoes are cheating. Went 1.5 sizes up but they were still comfortable so I may go a half size up. Blew through my intervals. My heart rate when up to threshold but my legs didn't feel it at all. Much different feel than the Endorphin Pro 3.",
      "I must be weird but the EE2 doesn't feel that unique - I like it but it reminds me of a RC Elite 2 re softness and bounce, albeit with a more flexible plate.  Both have great uppers.  Neither is as protective or propulsive as an AF1.  My Neo Zens are just as bouncy, plus have considerably more cushion in the forefoot.  For me, the EE2 rewards a midfoot strike more than forefoot, where I bottom out."

    "selftext": "58 year-old mid/forefoot striker at 5\u20198\u201d, 150 lbs.  After many years of wearing size 9\u2019s, I now go a half size up to 9 1/2 in Adidas and Asics to have more room in the toe box and avoid losing toenails.  Easy 9-10/mi, 7-7:15 5K, 7:30 10K, 8:15-8:30 half, 10 marathons ranging from a 3:27:16 BQ to over 4:30.\n\nI took the Pro 4\u2019s out for a 9 miler today with 3 miles easy, 3 at HM pace, and back down to 3 easy.  Seeing as this shoe is the upgrade to the EVO SL, this could almost be considered a copycat to my review of that shoe with a few tweaks. \n\nPositives for the Pro 4:\n\n- Lightstrike Pro foam is so good.  The cushioning is soft yet firm. Just feels great right out of the box and should get better with more mileage.\n\n- Energy Rods 2.0 gave the shoe quite a bit more spring than the EVO SL\u2019s.\n\n- Upper has a better feel to it than the EVO\u2019s.  The Lightlock lacking system kept the laces in place and, well, locked in.\n\n- The grip on the Pro 4 is far superior for sure due to the LIGHTTRAXION compound.  It\u2019s almost as if the shoe was grabbing the asphalt and throwing me forward.\n\n- So lightweight. According to the Adidas website, they come in at 7.05 ounces in a size 9.\n\n- The rocker position comes up quick and the transition/toe off is excellent.\n\n- Roomy toe box, both in width and height. I did not experience any rubbing at all.\n\n- More stable than the EVO\u2019s.  I really don\u2019t know how this is as the heel is narrower, but that\u2019s the way they feel to me.  Maybe the slight increase in the forefoot width.\n\n- The white/black/red colorway is so classic.  Love it!\n\nNegatives:\n\n- My legs were a little fatigued after the run.  Could be due to a lot of factors from today, including the 80 degree heat that I am not quite accustomed to yet, but usually a 9 miler won\u2019t have that effect on me.\n\n- Not recommended for heel strikers due to the narrow heel.\n\nI never in a million years would have thought I would ever had bought a pair of the Pro 4\u2019s as I despised the 3\u2019s due to the clunky ride that made them feel heavier than they were.  However, due to how much I love the EVO SL\u2019s, I took a chance and really, really like this shoe.  It\u2019s definitely an upgrade, but is it worth an extra $100?  Even thought the Pro 4 will be my half marathon and above shoe going forward, my initial thought after the first run is if I had to choose that I would go with the EVO SL as it is more versatile and I just don\u2019t think the advantages are worth the extra cost for the everyman/woman runner.  I may change my mind after the second or third run, but for now I would only go with the Pro 4 as a dedicated race shoe.  If you are looking to shave an extra minute or two off for a BQ, NYCQ, Berlin Q or PR, then for sure the Pro 4 is worth the extra money\u2026..but that\u2019s the whole point of the shoe!\n\n",

      "The Evo SL and the AP4 are not really based on each other, they just have similar styling and colorways. They have different foam, with a completely different softer new light strike pro in the AP4. The geometry of the shoes are also different, as are the last (and fit)."

    "selftext": "\n\nThis is my experience with the Cielo X1 2.0.  \n\nAdditionally I have the X1 and absolutely love them.    I primarily use them as a long run shoe.    \n\nRocket X2 has been my race shoe for the last 2 years.   May be my all time favorite racer.   Just got the Cielo 2.0 so it\u2019s possible to move to #1 for me. \n\n55 yr old.  5\u201910\u201d 175 lbs.  Midfoot striker. \nAvg 5k =19:15\n10k =39-40 min\n13.1 = 1:30 \nNot a marathoner so this information may not apply if you are.   \nAvg 30 miles per week\n20+ races per year. \n\nUsed the 2.0 for several threshold runs.   Mile repeats at 6:10 mile.  Have an upcoming 5 miler I will race in them.   \n\nMIDSOLE:\nAmazing bounce and energetic ride.   Smooth ride that gets even smoother the faster you go.   It is truly a slimmed down X1 however it feels slightly more energetic and nimble.   Extremely fun and effective.  \nRocker is aggressive.   When you hit your paces the shoe is so smooth.  \n\nFIT:  \nFit is TTS for me compared to my  X1 and Rocket X2.    \nNo gaps or puckering in fabric. Ample toe room and width.   Foot is secure however no hot spots.  \nI like the solid heel counter.   Foot is held in place and I don\u2019t even notice the heel.  \nThe laces are not saw tooth however I\u2019m pleased with them.  No slippage at all.  \nTongue stays in place and is a good length.   It is not gusseted however it does a great job of staying in place.  \n\nSTABILITY:   \nThe heel is very soft so just walking or standing feels like a negative drop sometimes.  \nI think that is also due to the cutout in the heel to eliminate weight.  \nI have zero stability issues during the run.   I am a midfoot striker and this shoe is stable as long as you do not heel strike.   I\u2019ve had some turns and direction changes during my threshold runs and I was not concerned about stability.  \n\nA lot of influencer comments about lack of stability however you should try it for yourself and make your own decision.   \n\nI don\u2019t have any concerns or issues with this shoe.  \n\nOverall I\u2019m very pleased with the x2.0 and like it better than expected.   I have experience with Alphafly 1, Vaporfly 2 & 3, ASICS Sky and Endorphin Pro 3.  \n\nEveryone is different and respond differently to shoes.   I hope my experience helps someone if they are interested in the X 2.0.   Lots of great choices available and an amazing time to be a runner.  ",

      "I trialed these after a local race and holy cow, they are just divine.  \n\nI find v1 to be fun, but not very productive.  Tons of bounce, but it doesn\u2019t really get me anywhere.  Still a wonderful shoe, but for $275, I\u2019d like more than \u201cfun\u201d.  \n\nV2 nailed it for me.  Smooth, the rocker is perfect, the fit is 100% (compared to 1 that is baggy, giant and at least 1/2 size big), the bounce and rocker now move me forward vs just \u201cfun\u201d (although it\u2019s still a fun shoe).\n\nI am nowhere near as fast as you, almost a foot shorter, weigh quite a bit less and heel strike like a boss and the ride for me is just as you described.  \n\nIF someone has pronation issues and is going to be doing any easy/slower running, this is probably not the shoe for them.

    "title": "Asics Novablast 5 after 500km (310~miles)",
    "selftext": "Hello guys, I figured that novablast 5 is a very popular shoe and at the same time I haven't seen a review after a higher mileage yet so I decided I will provide one.\n\nInfo about me: I am an average runner running for two and a half years and got into running from cycling. My height is 180cm (6 feet) and weight about 85-86kg (186lbs) so I am slightly heavier runner. Midfoot striker.\n\nTimes: 5k 20:48, 10k 43:40, HM 1:38:33, M 3:57:15\n\nBefore NB5 I had used On Cloudeclipse for my first marathon training and did every session and the marathon itselft in them with total mileage of 620miles and Asics gel cumulus 24 before that for casual running and first halfmarathon as I got into running with total mileage of 650miles. Since then I bought edge paris for my races ( I have run 3 10km races in them so far and are awesome)\n\nI have got this shoe for Christmas so I have ran 500km in them in 3 months time. As money is kinda tight right now, this is my only shoe in my shoe rotation beside my racing shoe. I have a halfmarathon on 6th of April which is my A class race for this year beside marathon in the fall season. I am following one of the coros training plans and I am running 6x a week.\n\nAs i said, this my only training shoe so I have run everything in them - easy, z2, tempo, HM intervals, longer runs with HM pace, strides - everything with longest runs being up to 18km. This adds up to 50 - 70km weekly depending on the week.\n\nMy thoughts after 500kms:\n\nAs you can see, the wear is kinda high and visible with the upper torn in multiple places. I can only compare with the cloudeclipse and gel cumulus 24, but this kind of wear on cloudeclipse was after approximately 700km and the gel cumulus 24 with 1100km still look better today than the NB5 after 500km. On the other hand, the upper is very breathable and thin compare to the upper of gel cumulus and the cloudeclipse got even worse damage but after more kms. I don't think I got damage on them after 500kms. The tongue and the laces I had no problem with.\n\nThe outsole looks almost like new with slight wear on the outer parts which i land on. However compared to the cloudeclipse it is great and it looks similar to the outsole of gel cumulus which also has great outsole in my opinion. However, i find the NB5 outsole less grippy mainly on wet tarmac and when I picked up the speed during strides (3:20min/km) or some faster intervals (~ 4min/km).\n\nNow the midsole. At first, great. Yes, it is very springy, yes it is fun to run in. The shoe is light, it bounces perfectly under you and it kinda makes you do a higher and longer strides thanks to the bounce. I actually used to run more cadence style but running in NB5 my cadence got lower a bit and my strides got longer. Very easy steps. The shoe felt the best mainly around steady Z2 and tempo paces (around 5:00 to 4:30min/km for me). In very easy runs, it did not feel somehow special and for more harder workouts and strides I sometimes lacked the grip as i said. I would say I enjoyed the shoe for maybe 300km maybe even less before the attributes of the shoe just vanished and after 400km they got worse from run to run. After 500km the midsole is completely dead and it feels like I am running on rubber pucks. There is no response all together. No bounce. Nothing. Yes, the foam is still there but that is it. Nothing to it anymore. I dont think the other shoes I had are this dead after more than 1000kms in them. I have actually gone for a run in my old cumulus 24 and they feel better after 1100kms and they are more firm new from the box. The last few runs until I was convinced to order new cumulus 27 were very unfun and hard to run.\n\nOther issue for me was stability. My right foot is over pronating a bit but I have never had any issues/injury/pain other than worn out shoes to the inside. You can see from the picture from the back that the right shoe is slightly tilted inward to the left from my overpronating. The heel on NB5 is very stacked and it did not help as I was using it everyday and it got uncomfortable for my ankle in the last few tens of miles ran in the shoes. However, as i said, I had no issues prior even in cloudeclipse which are also high stacked and had used them a lot. Stability has also convinced me to go for the cumulus again next as the stack is lower.\n\nOveral, I understand that I am a heavier runner and that using the same shoe 6x a week is not helping, however, this shoe is promoted as do it all and with its price around 150\u20ac/$ I would say it is supposed to be a workhorse shoe for daily kms/miles and with my prior experiences with daily runs/longer runs shoes lasting up to 800kms and more I am kinda disappointed that the novablast5 are dead after maybe 200 miles as I was overusing them and did not feel any benefits for the last 100miles for sure.",

      "Thanks for this review. I was planning to get these shoes because my Novablast 4 is nearing at 600km+ mark. I am choosing between these shoes - novablast 5, new balance rebel v4, adidas evo SL, and Puma deviate Nitro 3. I am the same height as you OP and my weight is around 80kg. doing my first marathon on November and I need new shoes for continues training. What can you recommend?",
      "I'm afraid this might be a common case for most NB5 out there. 300km in and already loosing its bounce and plush, felt flat when landing even at slower pace. I'm surprised my 800km 1080v13 withstand better than this",
      "I got to about 250 miles before I really noticed that the midsole wasn\u2019t nearly as responsive as it was. Given that the price of the shoe is on the low end of the \u201cpremium\u201d shoe price range, I didn\u2019t complain too much.  Curious, what is your race shoe?",

    "title": "Topo Magnifly 300-400 mile review",
    "selftext": "So a little backstory. I came off of Hoka Cliftons. Hoka has served me well, meaning I was getting a lot less knee and hip pains but my toe pain just kept getting worse and worse. It was getting to the point to where I had thought about going to the doctor. I have ran 2 marathons in Hoka shoes, but I was thinking I needed something different. I have known for a while that I have high arches and wide feet for a while now, and Hoka just doesnt offer a lot of toe space to accomodate my feet. After some review, I decided to try a shoe with a wide toe box. I also wanted to try a zero drop shoe, because going from a 12mm drop to a 5mm drop made my knee and hip pains go away almost completely. This limited my options to Topo or Altra.\n\nReviewing Topo vs Altra shoes at the store revealed to me a few things. Altra is the better known brand and has the most reviews. Topo is kind of the lesser known little brother. Although Topo doesn't have as many reviews, it was pretty obvious to me that they made their shoes out of better quality material. Altra seemed to make their shoes out of plastic. They felt almost polyester like. My feet were sliding in them when I had them fully laced up. I determined this might be a problem on long runs as it may produce blisters.\n\nTopo on the other hand seemed to make their shoes out of a felt or maybe cotton. They 'gripped' on to my feet a little better and felt like they weren't as cheaply made like you would imagine a plastic shoe. Topo in general fit my wide feet and high arches like a glove. It 'gripped' on to my heels, supported my arches, and allowed plenty of wiggle room for my toes. This made my decision to go to Topo. I decided to go with the magnify for the zero-drop option although the phantoms with their 4mm drop seemed to be more cushioned. This would be one of my only complaints as time went on.\n\nMy first few runs I had some knee discomfort and some Achilles discomfort. Although I contribute that to adaptation to a zero drop shoe. As the weeks passed on, that pain soon went away. My toe pain also got much much better as well with the roomy toe box these shoes provide. For reference, I have been using these as my only running shoe and putting in 30-40 mile weeks.\n\nI have been wearing them not only on my runs but also at work. They are holding up alright. The tread is starting to wear down though, but to be expected with the miles I put on them.\n\nMy complaints with this shoe is that I wish I had gotten a size slightly larger or possibly in wide. Although my toe pain is better, I still could use a little more room on the edges of the shoe. Topo seems to size their shoes smaller than what's advertised. My other complaint is that there is not enough cushion. It is marketed as a 'medium' cushioned shoe but imo it could easily pass as a 'low' cushioned shoe. My feet hurt on long runs, something I hadn't seen with wearing my Hokas.\n\nOverall, I would give this shoe a 9/10 score. It is a good quality shoe but fits smaller than advertised and is a little less cushioned than advertised. My next shoe is definitely going to be with Topo, and I'm eyeing the Phantoms. I'm not completely sold on zero drop and those Phantoms do seem to have better cushioning.",

      "Jesus did you take a belt sander to them?",
      "Get into a store to try on the other topo shoes if you can. The spectre and cyclone feel like fun shoes with a more responsive midsole.",
      "I can vouch for the Phantoms, got 500 miles on them and they could have gone farther. They're a lot like Cliftons but with the wider toe box and a more durable outsole. I have the Specters now and they're more lively. The Specter has plenty of cushioning for long runs. The only problem for me is that the extreme heel flare seems to be the culprit behind tendonitis at the top of my hamstring. I just switched to the Mount to Coast R1 and the tendonitis eased off within the first few runs. I haven't heard anyone else mention the tendonitis issue, so that could just be my geometry or something, overall the Specter is a shoe with a lot to like.",
      "You should look at the specter 2 for your next shoe. It\u2019s perfect for marathon training and even running a marathon in. It\u2019s a little on the firm side but very responsive and fast."

I\u2019ve found Saucony has been the absolute best fit to my feet so current rotation is Ride 17, Endorphin Speed 2 (got a great deal on a barely used pair), and Endorphin Edge for trail. Increasing mileage so looking to add an easy/long shoe to the mix.",
      "One month into my Ride 17s. It's the first running shoe I've ever owned and definitely quite happy with it. My initial plan was to get Reebok Floatride because there was a deep discount and just happened to see the Rides at a similarly marked down price. Think I made the right call ultimately.",
      "The Endorphin Pro 2s are still chugging along. I\u2019m about 250 miles into them as a pure speed shoe, and I\u2019ve put them through the wringer. Sure, they\u2019ve lost some of the pop they once had, but the outsole is in good condition and they are still snappy with that carbon plate.",

      "Novablast 5s have become my all-time favorite shoe.  \n\nI swear the grip is getting better with age, not that it was bad to begin with. I ran 2k repeats on a cement path in the afternoon after it snowed in the morning. There were some downhills with tight corners with snow melt on them. NB5 stuck to the concrete very well & I didn't even have to slow down much on the turns. I've done this workout in Adios Pro 3s & can't get them to lockdown for the life of me so had to slow way down on corners with them (they also don't feel grippy at all to me), but NB5s handled the workout better & protected my legs throughout. \n\nAlso ran a long run earlier in the week & with over 300 miles in the shoes, they're still soft & bouncy throughout entire runs feeling like new. They protect my legs really well.  There's nothing this shoe can't do. I'm planning to take them to 500 miles & then will have to decide about getting another pair, or trying something else.",

    "title": "Saucony Endorphin Trainer",
    "selftext": "I'd been waiting for the Endorphin Trainer since I heard about it as I really enjoyed the Kinvara Pro and this is basically version 2 of the Pro. When the negative reviews started hitting I had some second thoughts... until I won a free set of Sauconys at a 5k and decided to give them a shot. I'm glad I did! The Trainers improve what I liked about the Kinvara Pro, fix the things I didn't, and only take a small step back in one area.\n\nA little about me for context: Male, 170#, 3:11 marathon, heel striker. I've but a little more than twenty miles on the Trainers so far.\n\nThe ride is similar to the Pros, but a little bouncier with the new foam. It seems to really work well if you heel strike as there's more incredirun (what a lame name) foam at the forefoot than at the heel. This adds a rolling sensation as the foam compresses which compliments the plate and rocker. When I tried landing mid- or fore-foot the shoe wasn't nearly as pleasant. Because these are relatively heavy for trainers, they don't shine at really fast work, but excel at holding a slow to moderate pace. That rolling sensation I mentioned earlier feels phenomenal when you lock in to about thirty seconds to a minute slower than marathon pace and cruise. The Kinvara Pros devoured easy miles and I expect these to do the same.\n\nThe biggest improvement is the upper -- the Kinvara Pro was a little warm for my taste and the Trainers have much better ventilation. I didn't have an issue with the Kinvara's lack of rubber on the outsole (I got roughly 400 miles out of a pair), but the added rubber on the Trainers should make them more durable.\n\nThe only real complaint I have is these are noisy. They have a pronounced \"clomp\" that can be a little distracting if I don't have headphones going.",

      "Just got a pair (before reading reviews) after my purchase while waiting for them to arrive I pulled a few reviews up and got a little nervous.\n\nI took them for a short spin today it was very short and on the treadmill but I love the bounce and the returned energy. They feel a little less stable similar to other endorphin shoes I have (pro, speed) in terms of the potential to roll your ankle if you are a side striker (coming off an ankle sprain in the pros)\n\nAnyway I\u2019m going to give them a chance and use them for my longer runs 10-20miles alternating with the triumph 22 which I LOVE.

Sized at EU 45/US 11.5, these shoes fit true to size with a secure midfoot and comfortable toe box. The Nitro foam remained lively and responsive for the first 700km, then softened slightly but continued to provide comfort.\n\nDurability has been impressive compared to other models I\u2019ve tried - the Adidas Takumi Sen 8 upper failed after just 70km, Saucony Endorphin Speed 3 at 300km, and Puma Velocity Nitro 2 at 400km. Despite the upper failing at the right big toe around 700km due to my specific gait (keeping my big toe up while running), these shoes have outlasted my expectations.\n\nEven after trying premium models like the Alphafly 2 and Vaporfly 2, I keep returning to the Deviate Nitro for its superior comfort and versatility. Initially planning to retire them at 1000km, I\u2019ve now extended their life goal to 1500-1600km (1000 miles) as they continue performing well.\n\nHas anyone here used the original Puma Deviate Nitro and upgraded to the Deviate Nitro 2 or Deviate Nitro 3? I\u2019m looking for feedback on how the newer models compare as I\u2019m searching for another workhorse shoe.\n\n**Worth buying?**  \nAbsolutely worth buying - a versatile, comfortable, and durable running shoe that outperforms many premium alternatives for everyday training.",

    "selftext": "Hello,\n\nReview for Mizuno Neo Vista after 600kms (604km when photos were taken)\n\n**TLDR:**\u00a0Fun bouncy shoes for shorter (less than 15k) faster paced runs on road surfaces.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ptau3v6cb0qe1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb11a24f76887dcdf6f007f899a3edbefe99182c\n\n**Info on me:**\u00a051 years old, 5'10\" 155lb, midfoot strike (maybe! see review and photos), 45-65mpw, average easy pace 8:00 min/mi. Size purchased is US10.5\n\nI purchased these in 2024 when they were released in Australia. I did not use them a lot or regularly during 2024 as I have quite a number of shoes in the rotation, however for the past couple months they have been my daily shoe.\n\nI've used these for moderate/hard pace 5-10k (I set my 10k pb in these) and slow long runs of 20k+. I don't recall going beyond 25k with these (reasons below).\n\n**Outsole:**\u00a0I started noticing wear at about the 400-450km mark. The wear pattern on these is really different to every other shoe I have worn/worn out. My usual wear pattern will start towards the heel/midfoot on the lateral/outer edge and then run across on a diagonal line towards the toe on the medial/inner side. I've got 22 'retired' shoes in strava and i can't think of any without this same wear pattern. The vista seem to have worn on the medial side only and start way at the heel, have a section of little wear and then a lot at the forefoot. It certainly doesn't feel like i'm heel striking when wearing these but evidence states otherwise. They're also a bit noisy when running uphill. They sound somewhat like horse shoes clip clopping. I expect this is due to the big cutout. The photo below shoes the areas of the outsole with noticeable wear.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vydcpcydb0qe1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdf6c5ce3513c9df696a2120522786a87d3df084\n\nOn road / pavement surfaces the outside provides good grip. On any loose/compact gravel they're not good at all. I tend to feel my feet slipping every time I land and I am constantly thinking about it when i use these on anything other than a road surface.\n\nThis next photo is of the heel section looking towards the forefoot.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/91t2wuyeb0qe1.jpg?width=764&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36f60c225cfd1071a1ce2ef0fead0718ceab4ba9\n\n**Midsole**: These were my first 'bouncy' shoes. Going from wearing mizuno wave rider (from v15 to 27) and other brands, when i tried these on i was shocked. I really didn't know that shoes could feel like this. They do feel strange when standing around or walking. I think this is due to the shape of the rocker which cuts away a bit at the heel (though nowhere near as much as the rebellion). When running I find they have a sweet spot for me at the 4:00 - 4:30 per km pace. Faster than this and there's better shoes (metaspeed edge paris). Once you're over the 5min pace they're kinda just bouncy and not really giving you any benefit. Again i think there's better shoes for paces at 5 and slower (asics glideride max). After 600kms they're still quite bouncy though i've not tried new ones on to compare. My only grievence with the midsole is running uphills. They feel too soft and I tend to land in the wrong place on the shoes particularly on steeper hills to get the benefit of the rocker.\n\n**Upper:**\u00a0I said to someone a while ago that i'd be happy if mizuno took the upper from saucony endorphin speed3 and placed it on the midsole of the neo vista. The upper is a stretchy / booty material which can be a little hard to get on. Once on I do not really need to tighten the laces at all. To me, the upper is the biggest issue particularly on long runs. Long runs when it is warm are especially bad. I can happily wear these for 1.5 hours but after that i start to notice my toes getting sore. If i run longer than 2 hours then I've usually got a couple toes which are red/bruised toenails etc. This is why i've not run beyond 25kms in these.\n\nI have also noticed lately a slight heel lift/rubbing on my right foot as if the shoe is too large/long. I don't know if this has always been there or perhaps the upper has stretched a bit. It's not evident on my left and i've not changed socks etc. If you can get along with the upper and have maybe a slightly narrow foot, then they'd be great.\n\nAlso, the laces are comically long. See photo. They also come undone a bit so i find a double knot is worth doing (maybe that's why they're so long?)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xb52k6agb0qe1.jpg?width=2201&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81ffb24c20bc81348d9cbe66e45b649708802a9b\n\n**Tempo and distances:**\u00a0I usually potter about at 4:30-5:00 with some intervals in the high 3's/low 4's if the plan calls for it. These are marketed as 'super trainers' so i assume that means not quite race day shoes but everyday faster than your brooks ghost / asic glideride type trainers. I think these fit that category well as they do work better in the speedier paces (speedy for me).\n\n**Last thoughts:**\u00a0Would I buy them again? No - I think the endorphin speed range is a better all rounder and also cheaper in Australia. I've been a wearer of mizuno since the wave rider 15. I've owned most wave rider models up to 27 along with wave catalyst, wave neo etc. I don't know if its me/my running or Mizuno but I've somewhat moved away from the brand in the last year in favor of asics and saucony. I have zero issues with the longevity of the mizuno shoes i've owned. I've never had holes in the uppers etc. The only reason I've retired mizuno is the midsole has started to feel wooden or the outsole has worn away to basically nothing. I expect i'll retire these in another \\~150kms and like my other mizuno's the uppers will still be in very good condition as they are now.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions:)",

Half size up.\n\nThe moment I step in it\u2019s firmer than I thought it would be. It feels like it has a lot of stack but still stays very light which is a plus. Took a few steps and could feel my shin splints twinging a bit which lately I think caused by a higher drop shoe, but I still give it a go for my easy 8km on very knackered legs.\n\nThe ride again feels firmer than I thought it would be. The geometry feels very flat and feels a bit clunky somehow. It does however break in a bit after a few kms and I start to gel with the midsole. Still firm and flat but I\u2019m starting to appreciate the impact absorption. It doesn\u2019t feel to be too responsive and bouncy, it\u2019s just okay.\n\nThe upper, while breathable, I found to be very stiff. I feel like it didn\u2019t conform with the shape of my foot and causing some heel slippage and sliding. Hopefully it will break in and for now I think some tweaks on the lacing should work fine.\n\nOh lastly, the tongue and the laces on these are awful.",

The reinforced eyelets have made it so there hasn't been any lace bit which is a nice improvement over older adizero shoes. The tongue is the biggest downside and nearly had me returning the shoe when I initially bought it. I'd always feel it slide down on my foot and kinda jam itself on top during a run. That issue as mostly gone away or I just don't notice it anymore. The laces are also the standard adizero style and are quite annoying to use at times.\n\nMidsole: Don't really need to say anything about this. Lightstrike Pro with the small shank in the middle is wonderful to run on and has only gotten softer as the miles have ticked up. At 125 miles they are the most comfortable daily trainer I've run in. \n\nOutsole: I've started to notice a tiny bit of wear on the back of the Adidas white rubber but for 125 miles it's about what I'd expect. The continental rubber has seen zero signs of wear and I can still make out the individual grooves. It has also stayed grippy without cleaning and is amazing to use during a rainy run or after rain. I also have seen minimal scraping on the exposed midsole foam which is wonderful to see.\n\nScore: 8.5/10 \nThis score is lower than might expect from a glowing review like this but the short and sliding down tongue and bad laces are big downsides if you don't like the Adidas laces.",

      "The high price is mostly due to the shoe being assembled in Italy, just like the Atomo V7000 series. Not that other manufacturers aren't known for high quality shoes, but there's room in the market for consumers who want a \"well made shoe\" that isn't tied to East Asian factories (even though the components are made there). FWIW, I paid full price for my Atomo V7000-2's ($240 USD). I just crossed over 400 miles of running in them plus however many extra from walking (because they look cool too) and I can safely say I got my money's worth. I'm retiring them from running now. It's a fact that Diadora makes great shoes.",

    "title": "Mizuno Neo Zen After 36 Miles / 60km - Bouncy!!",
    "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/947mad82fope1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44bafde2fbdd6bbe93dfd9b69f034113487c7b33\n\n**TL;DR:** I really like this shoe for recovery, easy, and even tempo runs. I even think this shoe is better than the Evo SL. This should have been the Novablast 2.\n\nFirst, some background about me: I'm a male in my late 20s, 161-162cm tall, and typically hover between 59-62 kg. My PRs are 1:35 for the half marathon (hot climate) and 3:24 for the full marathon (cooler climate). I\u2019ve been running for four years. I typically have a high cadence of >190 and am a midfoot/forefoot striker.\n\nI ran the Osaka Marathon 2025 in late February, and while browsing the large Mizuno booth at the expo, I came across the Neo Zen. I had already heard rave reviews about the Neo Vista but wasn\u2019t compelled to get it. However, when I saw the Neo Zen, I read some online reviews saying this shoe is *bouncy* and a joy to run in. Seeing the word *bouncy* caught my eye. Since the shoe was competitively priced, curiosity got the better of my financial decision-making, and I bought the **Onihayai** colourway exclusive to Japan.\n\nAfter a few runs at different speeds, all I can say is: this shoe is **SUPER UNDERRATED** and is massively being slept on. Let\u2019s get to the basics.\n\n# Fit\n\nNarrow and surprisingly large. It\u2019s so large that I had to go **half a size down (US 8.5)** from my usual size (US 9). It\u2019s soft and comfortable with a sock-like fit, and the pull tab is well appreciated.\n\n# Upper\n\nNothing to rave about, but it\u2019s breathable. It has a lot of holes, and the material is soft and cloth-like. There\u2019s not much to say because it just feels standard, which isn\u2019t necessarily good or bad. That said, I appreciate the breathability since I train in a hot and humid climate. After **60km / 36 miles**, it still looks fine.\n\n# Outsole\n\nLooks durable\u2014I'm not worried about wear and tear. I\u2019ve run on wet pavement, and the grip seems solid. After **60km / 36 miles**, the sole still looks great.\n\n# Workouts & Ride\n\nThis is the part I really want to talk about.\n\n**YEAH. IT\u2019S BOUNCY. HELLA BOUNCY.**\n\nEvery step feels amazing\u2014I felt like I was on a trampoline. It reminded me of the Novablast 1 days\u2014man, that shoe was bouncy as heck. I felt like I was getting so much energy return that running felt effortless. Granted, it\u2019s not quite race-day fast, but it\u2019s fast enough to hit my tempo paces with ease.\n\nI\u2019ve done **two recovery runs, two easy efforts, and one tempo run** in these, and each time, the bounce just keeps on giving. Like other reviewers mentioned, I can confirm this shoe\u2019s midsole is **soft**. The \"MIZUNO ENERZY NXT (NITROGEN INFUSED VERSION)\" they mention on their website? Yeah, it\u2019s *really* soft and responsive. I keep wanting to reach for these shoes every time I have a recovery run, an easy run, or even a slight tempo run. If we\u2019re talking about Pete Pfitzinger\u2019s *Advanced Marathoning*, I\u2019d gladly wear these for my **recovery, general aerobic, and medium-long runs (MLR).**\n\n# Comparison to the Evo SL\n\nI\u2019m comparing these to the Evo SL because the Evo SL is getting hyped as *the* go-to \u201call-rounder/daily trainer\u201d on social media. I own the Evo SLs and have shared my thoughts on them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningShoeGeeks/comments/1hjz29o/review_and_thoughts_adidas_pro_evo_sl_adidas/).\n\nBut putting them side by side, for whatever reason, I really want to pick the **Neo Zen** more. Yes, I\u2019m happy with the responsiveness of the Evo SL\u2014the quick turnover in workouts, the firm and responsive ride. But when it comes to doing *everything*? Nah, the **Neo Zen takes the crown**.\n\nI really, really love this shoe more than the Evo SL. Both have their own strengths, but man, I just keep wanting to run in the Neo Zen over the Evo SL.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nI seriously enjoy these so much. The last time I felt this kind of bounce was when the **Novablast 1** first came out in 2019-2020. I haven\u2019t had a shoe this bouncy until the **Neo Zen** came along. And man, I\u2019m glad I let curiosity make the purchase for me.\n\nI\u2019m definitely grabbing more pairs of these when I get the chance.\n\nThis post isn\u2019t as polished as my past reviews, but I just had to write this because I feel like this shoe is **super underrated** and isn\u2019t getting talked about enough.\n\nThanks for reading!",

      "Zen > EVO SL\u2026 The tongue and the laces on the EVO are horrible",
      "I love my pair. A trampoline is a great comparison. They're my go-to for easy runs when my legs are toast. The sizing is half a size down for me and they fit tight, but not uncomfortable. I don't have as many miles on mine, but the outsole durability seems fine.",
      "One thing I continually see is the vast amount of people who mention a certain iteration of the NovaBlast they were highly disappointed with and it\u2019s rarely the same version soo many loved v2 and hated v3 then you have those who hated V4 and loved v3 etc\u2026. Myself I hate both SuperBlasts they\u2019re just an over rated over hyped big clunky shoe and despite being lighter than the NovaBlast 5 I still would run in my NB5 over the SB 1/2 every time.   Glycerin Max is a heavy blah shoe again that people convince you is so great; perhaps to make themselves feel better about blowing $200 on a shoe that really does nothing better than their other shoes already do.  The Evo SL has been stellar for my husband who has run through a a pir already, retired at 484 miles and is now 100 miles in on his 2nd pair out of the 5  he has (he \u201cneeded\u201d every color). They just work for him; myself it\u2019s the Neo Zen. It\u2019s not a speedy shoe nor is it meant to be however, everything else it does good.  I\u2019ve learned with all our shoe testing we have done and all the insane amount of shoes we have you truly have to run a solid 10 runs in every shoe at every possible pace and distance to see what that shoe is good at and at what pace it\u2019s best for you at.  It\u2019s funny to see a company synonymous with making Baseball products for decades become such a good brand in running as well.",
      "I went to a running store about 2 months ago and they brought these out. Never heard of them but once I tried them on I was sold. I have clocked around 35-40 miles in mine as well and LOVE them. I do agree on sizing down, or trying on in store before buying online as I had to go down half a size too"

    "title": "Fans of the Asics Novablast 3 rejoice, the Dynablast 5 is here!",
    "selftext": "[Novablast 3 vs Dynablast 5 side by side ](https://preview.redd.it/tsokoawteope1.jpg?width=3756&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e3e924ad438281cb81d9de6727ced4a4c6e1645c)\n\n* **Shoe Model & Size:** Asics Dynablast 5, US 9\n* **Fit/Comfort Notes:**\u00a0true to size, comfy and plush\n* **Use Case:**\u00a0road daily trainer\n* **Distance Ran:**\u00a025 km so far\n\nAbout me: 171 cm, 67kg. 5km 21'22\", 10km 44'31\", HM 1:47'41\", I run approximately 125km per month 70/30 split between road and trails.\n\nBeing a big fan of the Novablast lineage since its first inception, I was quite disappointed by how it developed into its 4th iteration. I didn't try the v5 yet (waiting for its price to drop) but I am so in love with the v3, that I'm now on my 3rd pair. I can say that the Novablast 3 is easily my favorite shoe ever.\n\nSo I was really happy to find out about the Dynablast 5 and it didn't take me long to grab a pair to test out. To cut it short: yes, they're the same shoe. It's no longer the lower stack budget complement to the Novablast line, but it's rather a direct successor of the Novablast 3. Midsole and ousole are identical, though the upper is different. Let's see what changed.\n\nWe have a knit material now, it feels stretchier and marginally roomier, but I suspect it will also be a bit warmer in the hot season. Overall the fit is identical to the Novablast 3, I consider it to be absolutely true to size. The tongue is still gusseted, but now it's a more traditionally padded one - nice, but I like the one of the Novablast 3 better. The laces are more basic now, but seem to stay put anyway. Finally Asics also figured out that flat laces work better with flat eyelets, hooray.\n\nThe Dynablast 5 heelcup is a bit more padded and resembles the one of the Novablast LE version. Heel hold is more or less on par with the Novablast, but maybe because of the slightly looser fitting upper, it feels a tad less secure here.\n\nOne of the nicest features of the Dynablast 5 though is inside the shoe. ORTHOLITE at last! Yes!!! We have Ortholite insoles here! I think this is the biggest improvement over the Novablast 3, because it makes the underfoot feel even more plush and the cushioning more pleasing. Maybe a minor drawback is that the shoe now feels a touch less responsive, but comfort on longer runs is clearly improved.\n\nThe changes in the upper resulted in a 22 g weight gain in my US 9 / EU 42.5. Novablast 3 tips the scale at 242 g vs 264 g of the Dynablast 5.\n\nNot much to say about the ride. It's the Novablast 3, plus a tad of extra plushness and a pinch less of racing grit. But safe from this small difference, it remains the same light, bouncy, easy on the legs and all smiles ride of its older sibling.\n\nAll that brings me to the conclusion that, as odd as it might sound, the Dynablast 5 is a great complement to the Novablast 3, whereas the former is leaning more to an easy-going kind of trainer and the latter remains the perfect \"long run steady pace to workout\" shoe for me.\n\nOne remark about the price: the offical retail price in EU is nonsensical. 130\u20ac is the same as the Novablast 5. I was able to grab my pair on Vinted for 65\u20ac from a user who used them once but wasn't convinced about the size. If you are able to find them at around 100\u20ac or less, it's a good deal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0dlr76xueope1.jpg?width=2709&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e005b79087cf90bbfed1535684608769dd2f711\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5r8o65xueope1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1b741438101dbc4f1495a4fd7389e8c8c757c6b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1946j6xueope1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eec96369868afc007ea50b0dc7ca7868032917a3",

That being said I was able to get a really good lock down in the shoe and was a big fan of the gusseted tongue and lacing.\n\n**Feel**  \nThe shoe has quite a high stack at 41mm with an 8mm drop, I personally usually go for slightly lower stack height on my every day shoes as sometimes find the stability of the shoe can become a problem for me on larger stacked shoes. That being said the shoe feels and is really stable. It is a soft shoe especially in the midsole not to the extent that you feel that you are running in marshmallows but soft enough that you feel that your getting a good level of impact protection which was a big driver for me with my weight especially when I first got the shoe.  \n  \nIt is not the lightest shoe and its not a shoe that I felt become an extension of me such as the EVO SL or for those who remember the Nike epic reacts. I ran up to 15 miles in the shoe and never experienced any discomfort except after one run where the padding on both the heels ended up rubbing away (still not sure how this happened as did not notice it on the run or have different socks on etc) \u00a0  \n  \n**Performance**\n\nThe shoe was fantastic for easy and long runs where the miles would just disappear and the legs would feel fresh this was a massive thing for me as I was building up mileage volume and wanted to try to protect my legs as much as possible. When working at the tempo range again the shoe was able to hold up however did not feel as slick as shoes such as the EVO SL and Pegasus Turbo and when running intervals or repetitions just didn\u2019t have the pep that I like and need. But as an everyday trainer I don\u2019t think that you can go wrong with it. In terms of grip the shoe has performed well I mentioned the stability earlier, I run predominantly on country lanes where there is a lot of agricultural usage so the roads are a mess and when wet and icy become slick excluding a couple of really icy days I had not issues with the grip of the shoe. I am now 350+ miles in and the upper and the sole are actually in good shape apart from the tearing on the heel, the cushioning is now starting to struggle and on the toe off can feel that its lost some of the structure this is really noticeable at 6+ miles at the moment now remembering that even now I am considered overweight I think the shoe has done well. I am still using it in my rotation but will be using it now for 4-6mile easy recovery runs and utilising the Adidas SL2 more for the longer easy miles.\n\n**Overall conclusions**\n\nThis is a really great shoe for its price, if you are looking for a daily workhorse which can cover the majority of your training needs then this would be a great option and at \u00a360.00 if you\u2019re a heavy mileage runner this represents great value. If you are a heavier runner and are looking for something that will provide you cushioning which will last then this is a great option for you. I have also ran in the NB4 but not to this extent of this shoe and actually prefer the NB3. The NB4 definitely feels firmer and slightly more responsive but I found the fit not as comfortable even though it has less volume than the 3 with me struggling on occasion to get as comfortable lock down. I also found that the 4 on the really slow recovery miles to not feel as comfortable.  \n  \n**Other shoes to potentially consider available now:**  \nAdidas SL2 \u2013 tighter fit, more responsive but still feels cushioned enough as a heavier runner over longer distances. Handles the faster miles better\n\nAdidas Evo \u2013 If your looking for a comfortable well cushioned non plated shoe which can handle interval and rep. This is a tighter fit which I like without feeling restrictive.\n\nHoka Mach 6 \u2013 Great alternative to this shoe which offers comfort at the longer runs whilst being nice and responsive.",

    "selftext": "About me: 5ft 8, 69kg. 5k 25min, 10km 48min, HM 1.45. Started running in January 2024.\n\nRecently picked up a pair of Nike Vomero 18 (UK size 8) from\u00a0\u00a3115. I've taken them out for two 10k runs so far.\n\nThe Good\n\nComfort - my god, the Vomero are so plush inside - feels like you're putting your foot inside a cushion! Everything just feels so padded inside and my feet feel great after a workout. The shoe fits TTS and there's a nice bit of room especially in the toebox. In comparison, while the Magmax are pretty comfortable, they don't feel as plush.\n\nCushioning/ride/midsole - The Vomero's are so soft - feels like the softest shoe i've experienced (compared to the Gel Nimbus 25 or Novablast 4). Yet not soft enough to make them feel like marshmallows, and they still retain some bounciness. It feels like a really smooth shoe which can just eat up the miles. Probably not the shoe for speed/tempo running - felt like the weight and the lack of energy return was working against me, but for easy/long runs, i think its just perfect. The Magmax is much more firmer (but still soft) but the energy return is far superior - feel that the Magmax is a more versatile shoe.\n\nThe Bad\n\nHeat - think the plushness will make the shoe really hot in the spring/summer - at the moment its still cold in the UK, but i suspect when the temperature goes up, its going to get hot!\n\nEnergy Return - think the shoe could do with a bit more ZoomX to make the shoe a bit more bouncier - its lacking in a bit of zip.  i guess they're saving this for the Plus and Premium versions?\n\nOverall - i've really enjoyed the Vomero 18's so far. The plushness and comfort are big positives and its a fantastic shoe for easy and long runs. I have a feeling that the Plus and Premium versions may rival the Magmax as my favourite shoe.",

    "title": "Alphafly 1&3 150-miles review: flawed goat",
    "selftext": "**TLDR**: The most amazing feeling shoe for people spending a lot of time on the ball of the foot, but the pods would roll your ankle under load.\n\nGrabbed an AP1 when they started appearing in stores. Never heard of them before, but the step-in was absolutely surreal so I got myself a treat for the advancing hobby.\n\nThe first proper long run was the longest I\u2019ve ever done: 17 miles through the streets. The shoe was loud, forcing a lower cadence, the shoelaces would untie 3 times. The foam would somewhat compress during the first 30-60 min making it necessary to tighten the lacing a couple of times. Despite all that, the feeling of running in it was unique and I had next to no typical lower-leg fatigue after.\n\nOne day as I was cramming my foot into the tongue-less upper and some of the heel counter rolled over itself creating an immediate and clear hotspot on the top of the heel. Nothing that I couldn\u2019t fix in a minute with a crochet hook but given the price I decided not to cut into the shoe and let Nike deal with it.\n\nThe replacement pair that arrived was glued together somewhat sloppy. The outsole stripes on the hill started coming off after the first run. The insole on the right shoe was glued in 1/8 of an inch further towards the left than it should. I eventually cut off some of it to reduce pressure on the inside of the foot.\n\nWhile I loved the light arch support and fit overall, the arch blisters were annoying. I eventually figured out that it is caused by - the drumroll - the upper that wraps over the bottom of the foot. Fixed it with a blister patch.\n\nThe good. I was still thoroughly enjoying the pair! It took me a couple of years to figure out what was so special about it. I spend a lot of time on the mid/forefoot. I land on it at HM pace, I land on it going up and downhill, and I maneuver on the forefoot. And AP1 has superb ramp geometry and great stiffness for that. The pods don't compress as much as the foam does. Meaning that at the moment of highest pressure under metatarsal joints you are still sitting pretty high above the pavement. And the roll is somehow longer. First the joint rolls on top of the pod and then you roll off of the pod. In addition to that, there is plenty of foam under the toes. I tried too many super-shoes and runner-ups that would have great foam but somehow too little of it in front of the shoe where it would actually make a difference. Overall, AP1 and Saucony Speed2 are the 2 shoes with the perfect ramp: starting just behind the metatarsal joints, and keeping a decent amount of foam under the toes.\n\nAs I mentioned, I land on forefoot even on downhills. Which is probably not ideal running mechanics. AP1 upper being, well, a sock doesn\u2019t do much to prevent cramming the toes into the front of the shoe. This causes toe blisters; the only lost nail happened to me in the AP1. So, I have to hold myself back on the downhills and emphasize landing more towards the heel in a race.\n\nThe shoe feels the most responsive to me at TH and above pace unlike any other. Not that I would recommend running in it at TH pace or above.\n\nAlphafly 3. It is just like AP1 but better in almost every way! Same intense \"this is just right and fun\" impression from the step-in that I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d experience again. They changed shoelace holes so they don't untie as easily anymore. Nike did away with the arch midsole cutout making the roll from heel to toe a little more natural. The fit feels a lot less funky, the upper is not wrapping around the bottom of the foot. The foam is ever so slightly softer, which I wouldn't say I needed but whatever. The only noticeable mechanical difference is that the pods traveled back a little, elongating the ramp and making the shoe ever so slightly less aggressive. This aggressiveness was what gave the 1s most of its magic. If I had an option to buy 1 pair new today I would still opt for the 3s.\n\nThe bad. Pods. Even if AP3 outsoles look wide, part of it is plain wider than the pods meaning that not all of the width is effective. Even the pods' width is not all effective due to rounded walls. In other words, I would discount the outsole width by 3/8 inch due to the way it is constructed. So, the footprint is fairly narrow. It takes a fair amount of single-leg coordination to balance on one foot in these. And unlike the foam, pods only get somehow less stable during running. So, no other shoe makes me as intimately aware of the ruts in the pavement. Towards the second half of a HM it means that I have to keep my eyes on the road at all times i.e. no searching through a playlist or running inside a pacer group.\n\nThe ugly. Pods again. Close to threshold pace during lateral moves the pods may straight up roll your ankle and they would do it with force. Say, at the water station, the runner in front of you suddenly decides to come to a complete stop and you try to swirl around the person. During the first step, your foot applies more force on the outside (of the foot) and as the load peaks the pod suddenly collapses on this side. And when it collapses on one side it directs more energy into the other side of the pod. This rolls the ankle and it rolls it with force and it with range. And if you don\u2019t control or stop the roll the ankle would just keep rolling. And it would not happen during a casual session, only when you are dropping the hammer. Both times I direly experienced it it was past 10 mile marker. Running in AP1 I rolled an ankle while casually pushing uphill and stepping on a pothole of negligible depth. Had to stop running for a few weeks because of that. And it was not the last time it happened. Let's say, under no circumstances I would do single-leg pogos in these shoes.\u00a0\n\nConclusion: AP1 and AP3 are essentially the same shoe to me. They gave me the most exciting miles I ever experienced, yet the most expensive and dangerous at the same time. The shoe is at its best when running fast but it gets sketchy past the marathon pace. I think it is amazing for runners that can run a full marathon on the balls of their feet. I would highly recommend training in it extensively before racing in it. This likely means that you'd need 2 pairs for a training block which is probably too expensive even for this sub.\n\nBest unobstructed straight-line runner for a midfoot striker, but it hides a significant risk of injury for the lesser trained of us.",

They are firm and not in an Adios Pro 3 responsive type of firm. But more so in a \"these are not pleasant to run in\" firm. In addition, they are cumbersome when trying to pick up the pace.\n\nSo I decided I'd give the OG Superblast a try and found a pair at a reasonable price on stockx. And my goodness have they been a delight to run in.\n\nWhen they arrived, I was struck by how much softer the bottom layer of foam is in the SB1 compared to SB2. Doing easy runs with strides on consecutive days wearing the SB1 followed by the SB2, it was immediately noticeable how much softer, bouncier and more fun the SB1 ride is.\n\nSo far, the only area where the SB1 is manifestly inferior to the SB2 is in the outsole. After every run, souvenirs have lodged themselves into the outsole cutouts. And this morning, during a run in the rain, the wet weather grip was terrible, so I won't be doing that again.\n\n**Worth buying?:**\n\nYes. I'll be logging a lot more miles in these during marathon training over the next few weeks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iqkox7wnmcpe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c50cd3a2c49b267cc7d5cb91a8e8ae0e18e8381\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cyovbwvnmcpe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8211ed3522ec04259af6afafcd1b7b3030b1435e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mucfd8tomcpe1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a9d58797d668330d3250d1d317375b1039f255a\n\n",

From the running I\u2019ve done in the 2s so far I wouldn\u2019t want to do a race in them, I feel like I get so much more energy and bounce from the SB 1 whereas the 2 is a bit meh, flat and clunky feeling to me. \n\nI\u2019m still on the lookout for a non plated shoe that feels like the SB1 :(",

For recovery runs. The newest addition to be worn tomorrow for the first time.\n\nSaucony Endorphin Speed 4. For intervals and races up to 10K. A little softer would be nice but oh well.\n\nAdidas Adios Pro 4. My only regret. Bought it for half marathons and marathons but don\u2019t know what I was thinking. I m never going to be as fast as this shoe needs to deliver nor I want to. Tried it on a half marathon and didn\u2019t like it, didn\u2019t give me anything, I don\u2019t seem to like this plush foam. Super shoes are not for me.\n\nAsics Superblast 2. For long runs and also promoted to running half marathons to marathons. Awesome.\n\nAsics Novablast 4. Served me very well for 350kms but feels blunt now. I ll keep this pair for now and find some use at some point (maybe taking out the trash).\n\nHoca Mafate Speed 4. For the 3-4 trail races I ll be doing every year just for variety. Fun shoe, didn\u2019t consider any other trail shoes, tried it, like it, kept it. Since the use will be limited to about 50-80km races per year in total, I\u2019ll also be using them for Saturday and Sunday morning walks in the park with the kids and various errands wearing jeans and a T-shirt. I like to look adventurous and interesting to mums also doing errands (I m not).",

    "title": "Hoka Cielo X1 1.0/2.0 First Thoughts Comparison",
    "selftext": "Background: M30 150 lbs, HM 1:35 Daily Trainer: Hoka Mach 6\n\n\n\nWhat I\u2019ve done so far: (2.0) 7 mile break-in run at 8:15 min/mile pace and half marathon at 7:15 min/miles.  (1.0) 10 miles with 5 miles at 9:00 min/mile pace and 5 miles at 8:15 min/miles.\n\n\n\nUpper Fit 1.0: Fits TTS.  More snug than the 2.0 on step-in but the material stretches.  Material is thicker and less breathable than the 2.0.  There is no structure around the heel and I did have some minor irritation from the lack of padding on the achilles.  I\u2019m using a version with the updated laces so no problems there.\n\n\n\nUpper Fit 2.0: Also TTS.  More spacious and very accommodating toe box.  Material is more plastic-like on the 2.0 and the upper has structure to it, very breathable.  The heel is padded and points out similar to the Mach 6 - which I absolutely loved for a race day shoe.  The 2.0 upper imo is improved in every way.\n\n\n\nMidsole/Stability 1.0: Platform is thick and bouncy.  Corners required some slowing down, but downhill felt great.  The lack of structure doesn\u2019t protect ankles as much on uneven landings.  Could feel the carbon plate more under my heels, so landing midfoot was preferable - but not required.  Foam/plate is very protective, and after the first run (5mi fast/5mi easy) I feel like these definitely helped reduce running effort.\n\n\n\nMidsole/Stability 2.0: More ground feel on these but still a protective foam (midfoot) platform.  Corners require slowing down and running downhill with the steep rocker was somewhat uncontrollable.  The upper structure combined with forefoot platform width helps the footstrike feel more controlled, BUT there\u2019s nothing to land on towards the heel, so you\u2019re forced onto that mid or forefoot.  Foam and plate still have a nice bounce but the rocker feels much more aggressive here.  Running feels effortless but the geometry can feel harsh on leg muscles.\n\n\n\nPace/Purpose 1.0: My intended use for these will be long runs.  That said, it is a carbon plated \u201crace day\u201d shoe, so it does push you faster than an unplated daily trainer would.  It still felt good at easy effort but it isn\u2019t something I would mindlessly easy cruise with.  It felt best imo at that slightly-faster than easy pace speed.  Picking up the pace felt great but only to an extent, they required much more effort maintaining my HM pace (7:15 min/mile) than the 2.0\u2019s did.  That in-between HM and easy effort pace was the sweet spot (8:15 min/mile) and was my preference.\n\n\n\nPace/Purpose 2.0: You can\u2019t easy run in these, period.  My attempt to do so on my first run defaulted straight to that faster 8:15 min/mile pace.  They feel incredible at that fast pace and completely effortless.  Even at that fast but not quite race pace-effort they beat up your muscles.  These are meant to go fast only and be efficient at doing so.  At race pace these will push you to your limit if you allow them to.\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts: I much prefer the comfort of the 2.0, but the aggression makes it a race-effort shoe only.  The 1.0 feels better for training runs, but it\u2019s not as comfortable, and I would not use it for race-efforts.",

I started with the 3, the LE version, and completely loved them. Reminded me of my second pair of Asics ever, the Roadhawk FF (2018, I think). An innovative shoe for Asics, the first one truly available made with the all new FF (FlyteFoam) foam, and one of their first running shoes without Gel.Bought a second pair, also the LE, and put more than 500km on each pair. To be fair, durability was not great. But got the two pairs for around 100\u20ac each, so it wasn't a bad deal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9itp4n6mv0pe1.jpg?width=1434&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d497cffe0d3a0673c5edce753cf25d1a33113ff5\n\nI tried the regular version of the 3, but the upper felt a little bit thick or, at least, not as breathable as the LE.After those, I got a pair of the 4. It wasn't a downgrade, but it's a different shoe. More bulky, more padded, the outsole felt more stable but firmer and a little cluncky. Don't get me wrong, I'm still using them as a daily trainer and for long runs. But they don't dissappear in your foot as the 3.\n\n[Same overall shape](https://preview.redd.it/yisy084ov0pe1.jpg?width=1433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42837a6d4e6634e5ec4571c998113cf503cc05cf)\n\n[The 4 has a more pronounced rocker?](https://preview.redd.it/go2kj34ov0pe1.jpg?width=1434&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0760b9166bf188e603f6c3f0399b9c61852bbb62)\n\n[The 4 has a wider heel than the 3 and the 5.](https://preview.redd.it/t0jdb64ov0pe1.jpg?width=1434&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5bf63c1004044febcdca295ef1de27695bf98504)\n\nIn my search for a shoe to run my first marathon, I got a pair of Endorphin Speed 4 but I made a mistake when choosing the size and I think it was for the best. Boy it's a fast shoe, but my goal is only to finish the race and the shoe it's a little too much for my intended pace. Maybe for HM, if I'm willing to lose a nail or two =D.\n\n[The Roadhawk \\(right\\) is a 42,5EU \\(US9\\) and the NB5 is a 41,5, US8.](https://preview.redd.it/xzkmn19sv0pe1.jpg?width=1434&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dab707149423861ee46b73cb155e6ea9c9a221a1)\n\n[Times change](https://preview.redd.it/gwi3t39sv0pe1.jpg?width=1434&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd13545cd70b0adb115f5186e9a3c1dc38ebed60)\n\nSo I went for the true and tested Novablast. The 4 it's on their lasts kms, and although you can find new ones in retailers, for basically the same price you can get the 5 from Asics (I'm in Spain, and discounts aren't as wild as in the US).Just did a progressive 15km and a 31km long run, with paces from recovery (6:45/km) to 10k (5:00/km) and they shine. I feel it's a back to form. Springy enough, a tad chaotic, more roomy in the toebox. It is a big shoe, not as nimble as the ES4 or the Deviate Nitro 2, but they just blend in the background and let you do your thing.\n\nJust a couple of naggings:\n\n\\- The shoe laces are a bit short\n\n\\- What's with the weird loop in the tongue??\n\n\\- Non existent grip (but from experience, it will improve).",

    "selftext": "**My Stats**\n\n181cm tall, 86kg powerlifter/runner, shoe size US12. 40:00 for 10km and 1:28 for half. Mid/heel striker. Slow rolling gait. Mild Pronation.\n\nReason for buying: New long run shoe\n\nI've had this for about 6 months now and as soon as I got it, I knew I finally got a legit replacement for my supercomp trainer V1s (which I would buy again in a heartbeat if I saw some come up in my size).\n\n**The good**  \nThe step in feel, the comfort and fit are really good for me.\n\nThe ride is soft and heavily rockered. Its surprisingly stable for a shoe this soft and tall.\n\nThe weight is good for the stack and it feels MUCH lighter than the skyward X that I purchased at the same time.\n\nThe nice part about it, is that even though its not the bounciest midsole around, the lower weight (for a big shoe) means its not too much effort go get going.\n\nFor me, this shoe really works as a long run / daily trainer, I can do intervals in it and its not too much effort given that its pillow like for the rest of the run.\n\nI think this works great for anyone that loves a heavily rockered shoe, If you are after a snappy footstrike, look elsewhere.\n\nPace wise its good for daily miles\u00a0**above**\u00a0recovery pace (anything 5:30/km+) , at medium pace (5:30 - 4:45/km) and though doing 1km intervals at 4:00m/km (my 10k pace) - these all felt great,\n\n**The Bad**  \nDurability: I'm 400kms in and have completely worn through the inner part of the rubber and what was a stable shoe is no longer so stable - the outsole here provided quite a bit of the firmness and distributes the load amongst the pillowy midsole, once its gone, you kinda just sink (reminds me of the invincible which I did not enjoy).\n\nAlso, give the softness, surprisingly its not a great recovery shoe, even in its prime once I got below 6m/km pace where I really heel strike on a recovery run, the heels just sink and calves have to work overtime (kinda defeating the purpose of a recovery run).\n\nAlso given the softness means 10k pace (4:00/km) can feel laborious - 10k pace intervals in a workour are fine (I did intervals of 500m - 1000m at this pace)\n\n**Buy again - Yes**  \n\\- I'll wait for the clearance specials on the v1 when v2 comes out\n\n\\- V2 is apparently going to be a little firmer, this could make the shoe even better (esp in the heel) or ruin it.\n\n**Comparison to Skyward X**  \nSkyward X is equally (or more) rockered, firmer, much bouncier, but feels MUCH MUCH heavier. I find that with the skyward I need to be going at a higher pace to overcome the weight, when I do they feel great, when I don't they feel rubbish. there is no use case where I prefer the skyward over the Neo Vista (though they are likely to be much more durable if that's your thing)\n\n**Comparison to Puma MagMax**  \nMagma is firmer, bouncier, less rockered, but surprisingly works much better at recovery paces, it can pick up the pace a little (its no speed shoe), and is great on gravel/dirt surfaces unlike the Neo Vista. The durability is much better too as is the price. Given how great it is at recovery paces, it will keep on getting used for some time.\n\n**Comparison to Supercom Trainer V1**The supercomp felt very similar, but had marginally better durability (lasted about 500kms for me) and were bouncier. They were heavier, but didn't feel that way. They also felt better and were runnable at recovery pace, whereas the Neo Vista's struggle.",

      "A few weeks ago I asked \u00a0about the B12 vs Evo SL. I\u2019ve seen people\u00a0describe both shoes being good for daily trainers/tempo shoe/budget racer.\n\nMy plan currently is using the Evo SL for my daily easy runs/long runs, B12 for tempo/intervals. So far it\u2019s been going great. I feel I can hit higher paces in the B12, and keep it up. Maybe it\u2019s the plate/maybe it\u2019s just me.\n\nThe Evo SL has been a joy for my daily runs, and a dream for my long runs. So far I\u2019ve done 16/18/ and 22km long runs in them and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a better experience in a shoe for those distances.\n\nAfter the last few weeks of this rotation I threw on my gently used Saucony Ride 17\u2019s and they felt dead in comparison to the Evo SL. The foam and ride experience is absolutely majestic in comparison. Plus with the rocker it feels like it\u2019s made to get your feet moving. I\u2019m not saying the Ride is a bad shoe, but the Evo is just that good.",
      "Y'all there's a buy $35 GC and get $15 bonus GC deal going on rn @ Groupon. Keep in mind the expiration date for the bonus GC (6/30) and that only 5 GC can be used per order on Adidas.",
      "I am not having a good time with the adios pro 3. Idk what it is, i get blister and my legs hurt running in the ap3. I am also slower in the ap3 compared to the EVO SL. Now the EVO SL, that\u2019s a great shoe."

I guess it's Saucony's attempt at a supertrainer a la Superblast or Zoom Fly 6? It's a little on the heavy side and there is a serious lack of outsole on this shoe with tons of exposed foam like some older Hokas had.\n\nI have serious concerns about the durability and wet weather grip.  It's also more expensive than the Nike ZF6 and Adidas Evo SL.  It's only $20 less than the widely lauded Superblast 2.  Saucony is late to the party with their supertrainer and going by the specs, it looks like the least impressive offering.  I'm seriously confused why Saucony would release such an expensive shoe that falls short of the competition.",

    "title": "Asics Superblast 2 x Novablast 5",
    "selftext": "5\u20199\u201d Male, 165 lbs, Weekly mileage 25-30~, US Men size 9-9.5 for most shoes. \n\nHi! Wanted to share my thoughts on the Superblast 2 with 268 miles on it now and the Novablast 5 after my second run in them for 8 miles total. Personally, picked up running last year to run a marathon with friends but ended up dropping out around a month out. Am determined to lock in this year for redemption. \n\nSuperblast 2 (size 9.5):\n- Fit: Snug but not in a bad way. I really liked how it fit overall and was much better than the 9 Wide in the Gel Nimbus 26 that FleetFeet initially recommended when I first started. I have a little under a thumb\u2019s width for my big toe and have had several toenails (second and third toe) go purple on two separate occasions during my longruns. Gotten a size 10 and still felt like 9.5 fit best. No blisters but had some mild discomfort towards the ball of my feet after 13 miles initially. Have not gone further than 16 miles in one run in them and feel like the discomfort is my feet just needing to get used to higher mileage.\n\n-Cushion/ Midsole: Going from a Nimbus when I first started running to the SB was a night and day difference. The shoe felt much lighter, responsive and firmer but it made running feel so enjoyable with that extra bounce. It helped lower how much fatigue i was taking during my longruns and it still feels like its got plenty of pep to give. That was the most surprising thing for me as I just thought initially firmer= less comfort and protection but its been amazing out the box to now. I am far slower than most of the people on the thread and am running at 9-9:30 paces on most of my runs. My favorite pace though for these is under 8:30 where it feels like its really helps open up my strides and propel me forward. Ive also done a 6:47 mile in them as a PB attempt months ago on a whim. Overall, its been a perfect companion for handling runs at any pace for me and I like how versatile it is.\n\n-Stability: Even with such a high stack I didnt have any stability issues and if anything I feel like the firmness of the shoe made it much more stable vs the Nimbus and the Novablast 5. I think its made even more apparent how stable it was for me when I started doing treadmill runs. The firmness made each stride feel more planted and controlled. With the Novablast and Nimbus, I could notice how much more energy I am spending stabilizing my body and keeping me more upright. Nimbus felt too soft and the Novablast felt like it had too much bounce. I thought the SB had the best balance for me with responsiveness and stability.\n\n-Outsole: Super grippy in all conditions. Love how reliable the compound is and wish the Novablast had the same grip. No complaints but am unsure if there is too much wear on them given i am just past 250 miles in them. Hoping they will last me past 400 miles.\n\n-Overall Impression: For a new runner, I feel like this is a do-it-all kind of shoe and would do the job for any workout if you could only have one pair of shoes. Comfort to last through long miles but has plenty of pep to pick up the speed, at least for the paces I can put up lol. Ive been super happy with it and am hoping to put plenty of more miles on them (:\n\nNovablast 5 (size 9.5):\n- Fit: Roomier toebox than the SB but not an exponential amount which I can appreciate. Its still snug but gives my toes just the right amount of space for a little bit more play than the SB. Length wise, I got a thumb\u2019s width of room for my big toe whereas the SB is probably more like 8/10ths of that. I do a runner\u2019s loop and felt like maybe the Novablast has shorter laces? Because of that I felt like it was much tighter around my ankles than the SB. Its fine to run in and I havent had any issues with it but its just a bit more tight than I\u2019d like and just seems too short when I tie them. I can tighten up the midfoot more so I can get more lace up top but maybe it will be too tight for me there. I\u2019ll play around with it more and I am sure the fabric will stretch more over time, allowing me to cinch up the shoes more in the midfoot for that extra lace length. \n\n-Cushion/ Midsole: Softer than the SB and much more bouncy but not as soft as the Nimbus 26. It gives me a nice squish like the nimbus but actually springs back whereas the nimbus felt more like my feet were sinking in. The bounce gives the shoe so much life and its been very fun to run in. Even with the bounce though I still feel like i get more tired in then than the SB since it is softer and I feel like that initial push off saps away a little more energy than the SB because my feet sinks in more. I have only attempted treadmill running in these so far and I do feel like me getting a little more tired in these is probably from me trying to stabilize myself more. This showed me i need to work on strengthening certain areas and probably work more on my strides. I will mention more in depth in the stability section but I felt more wobbly from the combination of the softness and bounce. Despite that, I view this as a refreshing experience compared to the reliable workhorse that is the SB. First run felt more wobbly and my second run in them today felt much better so just probably a little time and adjustment to get used to them will help. I dont think it will be as good for me at handling longer runs than the SB but will see. I havent done anything more than 4 miles in them and will be doing a 6 mile run tomorrow. Wanted to also mention I am running these in the same 9-9:30 paces as I have with the SB.\n\n-Stability: Strictly just running in them on a treadmill, my first run got me wobbling a little and I felt so awkward since it just feels so different from the SB. Its not a bad thing, just different considering I have only ran in these SB on every run from September 2024 till now. I think with some more runs I will feel more comfortable and accustomed to them. My second run was much much better but still not as stable as the SB for me.\n\n-Outsole: Worse than the SB and Nimbus. I would say this is the worst out of the three with the SB at the top. Havent ran in the rain fully but the slight jog from the parking lot to the gym during a rainy day was enough for me to not want to risk it. I see people mentioning its an improvement from the outsole of the 4s but I am not sure by how much. I am curious how fast they will wear out though compared to the SB from outdoor running.\n\n-Overall Impression: Fun and am so excited to test them out a lot more. Got these so I can use the SBs for mainly just longruns only to prolong its longevity. Though its a very different shoe, I think its going to be a solid daily trainer to give me something more to look forward to when running. SB is to me like the shoe I can rely on for anything and everything and the Novablast is the shoe that I feel like is more exciting and fun to just lace up and go. Both are awesome, just very different experiences.\n\nTL;DR - SB is more snug, less bouncy than the Novablast but grippier, more stable, and more comfortable for long miles. Novablast is exciting with the extra bounce but if I could pick one shoe to do any and all runs, itd still be the SB. \n\nI wish I could just get a bunch more shoes to try out for fun \ud83d\ude29\n\n",

    "selftext": "Saucony Endorphin Elite 2 - Review & Comparisons\n\nstats: M 5\u201911 70kg fore/midfoot striker + stride-based runner \n\nUpper/Fit:\n\nThe upper is probably the only concern/issue with this shoe. Despite going up half a size from my usual US10.5, I still got blisters on both my pinky toes. The plastic/net-like upper (similar to the VF2) and toebox taper is not a good combo.\n\nTo summarise my experience with the upper/fit:\n\nStay TTS = Toebox is too short and tapers way to aggressively\nGo up half size =  I get slightly too much volume in the midfoot and heel, and the stretchy laces create a challenge with lockdown\n\n(Probably the best heel counter on a super shoe though)\n\nOutsole: \n\nI ran in dry, smooth pavement so had no issues and generally don\u2019t have issues with traction or durability. The rubber is quite sticky/tacky and you feel it \u2018stick\u2019 to the road. Durability is up in the air.\n\nStability: \n\nI also don\u2019t have stability issues but the shoes are surprisingly stable especially going downhill and taking turns. I\u2019d say they\u2019re better than the PXSv1 and Mizuno WRP3 but not as stable as an AP3.\n\nMidsole/Ride/Performance:\n\nEven with the highest expectations, I was still blown away by how soft, squishy and bouncy these were. They give you that \u201cfirst time ever wearing a super shoe\u201d feeling. \n\nI took these on a 3x9km marathon-pace workout (4:00min/km - 3:47min/km). \n\nDuring the warmup (usually 5:00min/km), I felt an unreal amount of \u2018squish\u2019 then \u2018pop\u2019. This, plus the sharp forefoot rocker forced me to run at  4:25min/km (usually the top-end of my steady-run pace) and made it feel like recovery effort.\n\nWhen running at marathon pace, the shoes quickly match its speed of compression to your pace. The foam would squish and absorb the impact, then it\u2019d decompress and return that energy back while simultaneously kicking me forward with the rocker. It feels like a mix of the bounce of the AF1 with the sharp rocker of the AP3 (plus the softness of a tempur-medic mattress)\n\nHowever, I could feel either the plate or toe spring while running (both?). It felt like my feet were sitting in a spoon with my toes curled upwards. The feeling did disappear and only returned when I was quite fatigued and in pain because of the toe blisters. I also did experience forefoot chafing/discomfort as well, which could be the result of the plate stiffness/position, but could\u2019ve been caused by the upper loosening towards the end and my foot shifting around.\n\nWith the shoe being this soft,  having an 8mm drop and being a stride forefoot striker, I was also worried about bottoming out but the shoe maintained its performance and character throughout the entire workout. \n\nOverall, the EE2 have easily moved up to the number 1 super shoe spot and has de-throned the AF1.\n\nComparisons:\n\nAF1: Both shoes have that \u201cI\u2019m running way faster than I should but I\u2019m cruising effortlessly\u201d effect. However, the ride is slightly firmer,  more mechanical and less compliant - comparativey dull. Arch was also a slight annoyance.\n\nAF3: the AF3 is (to me) a more aggressive and duller version of the AF1. Similar performance but even more of a dull ride compared to the EE2. \n\nAP3: A lot less compliant (squish) but similar level of resilience and rocker. Both shoes \u2018kick\u2019 you forward similarly, but the EE2 also has the compliance, softness and bounce to it.\n\nAP4: Similar levels of softness to the EE2 but it\u2019s also less compliant and resilient and bouncy . The rocker is also gentler on the AP4 so these don\u2019t have the same \u2018kick\u2019 effect.\n\nOnCloud Boom Strike: Both of these have the same \u2018gooey\u2019 softness but the OCBS is much less compliant but still very resilient. Produces similar bounce to EE2 but less fun and very loud and squeaky.\n\nMSP: Much firmer, less compliant but more resilient and nimbler. Prefer these for 5k/10k races and workouts.\n\nPXSv1: Similar levels of fun. Although these are much firmer, they produce similar levels of propulsion and bounce. Hhowever the EE2 is lighter, more stable, comfortable and softer.\n\nPuma FastR 2: Underrated shoe. These also have a similar level of bounce and kick. However much heavier and firmer.\n\nWRP3: Similar level of squish and bounce but only in the heel/midfoot \u2018bump\u2019. Whereas, in the EE2, you get the same level of squish regardless of where you land, at a more controllable stack-height plus a rocker that kicks you forward. ",

      "I can occasionally feel the plate in the forefoot. When I used these in a marathon, I really felt it for about two miles (around miles 16-18), but that sensation disappeared thereafter. It's not problematic to me, just kinda there. A weird, unexpected firmness that's not always present. I'm approaching 200 miles in my pair, and durability has been excellent. Barely a scuff on the outsole, the midsole has retained all its dynamic softness. The upper has picked up a ton of stains, but that happens with any shoe used during the Miami Marathon.",
      "I had a similar issue with one pinky toe when running in them for break in and a total of 15 miles before my half marathon this past Sunday. Fordy mentions this in his YouTube review. During the half marathon (1:29:40 or 6:51/mile) I had ZERO discomfort. They are amazing. I purchased from my local shoe store and could return prior 30 days. My plan was to test prior to my full marathon on 4/27. I was going to buy a 2nd pair of AF3 or exchange if these didn\u2019t work. Suffice to say, I will be using these. They fit true to size for me and I have a wide forefoot. Other shoes I\u2019ve tried are Endorphin Pro 3 and 4, Adidas AP3 and 4, Saucony Endorphin elite 1, ASICS metaspeed edge Paris. \nThese are my favorite just ahead of AF3. \nI did not feel the plate or \u201cbottom out\u201d. \n50 y/o male, 5\u20199\u201d 165#\nI felt they were stable at most paces and have no stability or pronation issues.",
      "Love the comparisons. Had to google WRP3 (Wave Rebellion Pro 3).",
      "This is the only shoe I have tried where the upper was completely unusable. The taper from the little toe starts way too early, and you can\u2019t go a size up since upper is too roomy/insecure. Unfortunate since the midsole seems super fun.",
      "I listened to a reviewer who also said they felt like they could feel the plates, but weren't actually bothered by them.\n\nI'm pretty interested in these, but hearing some concerns about how they are fitting people's feet, I'd definitely want to try on first (Australian return policy is way less good than the usual American return policies!).\n\nThat, and i just copped adios pro 4 and cielo x1."

I love the lightness and response of the Evo SL, but the upper is way too big for me. I try to wrench it tighter, but the fabric bunches unnaturally, and it's generally not a snug fit. \n\nFor those who experience this, did you move to an alternative shoe, and if so, which did you find comparable?

Literally zero wear anywhere.\n\n**Midsole**  \nOn initial wear, I actually thought this shoe was a dud. Like the person before returned it because it was.  \nHowever, after walking around in it for a day or two, and taking it for an easy grass track session; the foam has really opened up.  \nNot as compliant as the Rebel V4s with Fuelcell but still less immediate than the Triumph20s with PWRRUN+  \nIt might look like it has similarites to the Clifton but the midsole is far more responsive and resilient and doesn't just collapse and lay dead.\n\n**Upper**  \nQuite thick, not the most breathable.  \nThere is a lot of coverage of the upper with sealed vinyl-like material around the midfoot.  \nProbably adds to the weight.  \nVery secure, very comfortable.  \n*Huge*\u00a0amounts of room in the toe box. I had issues with my Cliftons where my pinky toe would sometimes develop blisters in warm weather because the forefoot was too snug. I can barely get my toes to touch the sidewalls & roof in these.\n\n**Outsole**  \nForefoot looks\u00a0*very*\u00a0similar to the Clifton, but has thicker rubber pads.  \nMuch more coverage around the heel,\u00a0*very*\u00a0usable for walking & everyday wear.  \nAlmost 3mm thick from rough measurement.\n\n**Ride**  \nThis is a shoe that I wil happily wear all day and then go for a 10K run with mates in.  \nThe rocker is quite late, so it's stable for standing and the toe spring isn't annoying during all day wear.  \nI'm not a heel-striker but the heel bevel is smooth and perfect for walking.  \nThe heel & forefoot flares are both significant, and really makes it one of the most stable neutral shoes that I have.\n\nIt's not the fastest shoe around, but I still managed to crack 85sec 400m x 9 repeats on tired legs.  \nI have plenty of other shoes if I want to run faster than mara pace in.\n\nI have already bought another pair for casual wear because of the funky colour edition.\n\nIf I were to go on holiday and need one pair of shoes to do travelling & touring jogs/runs in, this is it.\n\n[Subjective comparisons of my current & previous daily trainers.](https://preview.redd.it/aliqp9q6ptne1.png?width=2483&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c6263b1cabd4c878a55478cc5cba81f38166fdd)\n\n[The Autopilots don't look too runners-fashiony, so you can get away with these as casual wear unlike AF3s in bolt yellow.](https://preview.redd.it/qj9wwgp9ptne1.jpg?width=2184&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1c3464925d7052a9d81bced5a4ed0a6254b6863)",

Runner loops & knots are required to avoid feet sliding slightly in the shoes. No lace bite unlike the AP3 and B12.\n\nI bought the shoes online TTS. It has much narrower toebox than AP3, my big toe can clearly feel the upper fabric and may feel a little tight fit but had no issues while running. If you have a little wide feet than normal, you should size up at least 1/2 size. Length is fine.\n\nThe red dye in heel collar sticked into my white socks after the run.\n\n\n\n**Ride and midsole:**\n\nMuch lighter on feet than the AP3. No bottom heavy feel.\n\nAP4 midsole is very airy, soft and bouncy, I can feel the midsole compress and decompress with a bounce very fast. It is even softer than the midsole of AP3 after 500+kms. (Considering the midsole in my AP3 has been soften a lots).\n\nMuch more unstable than the AP3 due to softer midsole, requires more ankle strength to keep the balance. Need to be more careful while taking corner.\n\nThe earlier rocker in the AP4 combines with the bounciness made it very hard to run slow in this shoes. I supposed to run at 5:15mins/km in my warmup but I was pushed to run 10s faster each km.\n\nVery consistent, lively, fast performance throught out the workout.\n\nLegs feel fresh, more relax after the run compared to AP3.\n\n\n\n**Outsole/Insole:**\n\nNot as grippy as AP3 but still OK, no issue whatsoever. Hardly feel the Continental piece.\n\nGlued insole like AP3 which is great but the printed text on it was scratched/peeled off from just 1 run (probably due to feet sliding slightly / I didn't use runner loops & knots).\n\n\n\n**Overall impression:** great performance, a little worry about durability/quality overtime.",

      "That sucks to hear about the dye and materials rubbing off so fast. One of the most important things is to keep the 3 stripes on the shoe.\n\nI'm curious about the instability. Do you think it would feel more stable for a heel striker landing on their heel and rolling forward to the rockered forefoot? Does it feel unstable at all speeds and cadences?",
      "For me personally, this is the first Adidas shoe where I\u2019d actually *avoid* using a runner\u2019s knot. Why? The heel seems to be built slightly higher than the AP3, with an extra cushion right at the Achilles. And that can cause some serious rubbing. Luckily, skipping the runner\u2019s knot solved the issue for me. As long as you lace the shoe tight enough, the Lightlock system still keeps your foot securely in place.",
      "Good writeup. \n\nI'm curious; are you able to tie runners knot/loop with the these laces? \nI find it really difficult, given how short they are.",
      "Great review. It sounds like a phenomenal shoe. I think the sizing has me most concerned considering the price of the shoe. I\u2019ll definitely go a 1/2 size up compared to my other Adidas."

    "title": "Brooks Aurora BL [Revisited]",
    "selftext": "About me: 33M, 5'8 and 195 lbs, shoe size 8.5. Lift weights 6-7 times a week and run 3-4 times a week. Preferred distance is 3 miles but sometimes I do push it to 6 or 7 miles if I feel like it. I run for fun and don't usually have a time goal in mind, just kinda run by feels and enjoy the good vibes \ud83e\udd19\n\nTLDR: I love this shoe so much and please Brooks, work on the next version! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\n\n\nWhen shoe was released in 2021 and it was instantly my favorite shoe of that year. This is actually my second pair (I think I got them in 2023) since the first one got messed up on one of my runs. I love everything about shoe: from the upper to the midsole to the way the shoe looks. In fact, I still get asked about the shoe and complimented whenever I rock these shoes for casual wear. The shoe is not on my daily rotation anymore but I still pull it out every once in a while and oh boy, it always puts a smile on my face when I run in it.\n\n\nThe upper holds up really well, hardly anything changed. The upper is very different from Brooks's traditional upper, it feels plasticky but it's still pretty breathable. The fit is perfect for my foot and the gusseted tongue really holds your foot down. What surprises me the most is the upper's durability despite how thin it is. I fell a couple of times in the shoe and rubbed the upper against really tough gravel surface and nothing really happened to it, no fraying, no ripping, nothing. The only thing I can complain about is how this upper traps dust really easily and it takes quite some time to clean it.\n\n\nThe midsole is still by far my most favorite iteration of the DNA Loft 3, it's soft yet bouncy. A lot of people would think that is a recovery shoe or a max cushion daily trainer because of how the shoe looks and they are not wrong. The shoe can be used for a lot of things but I think the shoe really shines at faster pace. At slower pace, the shoe is very plush and accommodating but at faster pace, that foam gets bouncy and provides a good amount of energy return. That combining with the rocker makes the run feel so effortless during those speed workouts. As we all know, the Glycerin was one of the first Brooks shoe lines to get the DNA Loft 3 after the release of the Aurora BL but for me so far, none of them has given the same kind of fun I feel when I run in the Aurora BL. Closest thing would be the Glycerin 21 Stealthfit but even then, the midsole still feels slightly mushy at times. The later Glycerin Max and Glycerin 22 are on the opposite side where the midsole feels firmer and not as balanced as the Aurora BL was. Now let me be clear, these are all great shoes, in fact the Glycerin Max and Glycerin 22 are both on my rotation right now. I just feel like the Aurora BL's DNA Loft 3 somehow didn't translate well to other Brooks running shoes and it sucks I won't be able to experience that kind of fun again since Brooks doesn't want to work on the next version.\n\n\nThe outsole so far looks pretty durable to me, I still ran the shoe a lot up until late 2024 and it seems to hold up pretty well. The only thing I dislike is that the little indentation on the outsoles creates some sort of suction cup effect. It makes those popping sounds on certain flat surfaces and that can be annoying sometimes when walking in it. Other than that, no other complaints.\n\n\nOverall, it's still one of the best shoes out there and even though it was released a few years ago, I dare to say it still competes really well with other shoes on the market right now like the Asics Superblast or Saucony Endorphin Speed series. I would love to run more in it but I'm trying to slowly savor it because I'm just trying to keep the shoe as long as I can. Again Brooks, if you see this, please release the next version or at least do a rerelease! I know you have it in your secret vault somewhere!",

      "Love these shoes and agree, the bounce is something else. Kinda unbelievable that it's a 2021 foam. There's shoes now that don't have foam that matches this one.",
      "I'm swinging by to acknowledge that pebble-carrying slot at the bottom. Does it need a tactical chopstick by the shoe shelf to examine the newly collected goods after a run?",
      "I picked these up randomly for under half price last year just cause I liked how unique they looked. Ended up being a really fun daily trainer, and I agree that Brooks really hasn't put out anything else quite like this shoe.",

      "If anyone is thinking about maybe getting the Adios 9 atm, do it \ud83e\udd29\n\nWent to do 2 or 3 miles to see how they fit, also on tired legs. Ended up doing over 7 at different paces and they felt brilliant. \n\nI have the Evo SL aswell and I personally much prefer these Adios 9. Obviously if you are using the Evo for long runs they will be better but anything under half marathon distance these will be perfect \ud83d\udc4c",
      "Probably the worse place to ask, but I'm curious if anyone feels like Adidas shoes just don't fit their feet? I bought some M11.5 Boston 12's almost a year ago. I get bad heel slip in them and figured I just bought a half-size too big. Last week I picked up a pair of Agravic Speed trail shoes at the outlet for cheap and I have the same poor fit in the heel no matter what I do. This time I had both the 11 and 11.5 to try on and the 11 absolutely did not fit me at all so I know I'm not a size too large. I've tried the runners knot and cranked it down hard, but I don't really get any improvement. \n\nThere have been some Adidas models that intrigued me, but at this point I'm concerned my feet just don't fit the Adidas foot shape. FWIW, I run mostly in Saucony shoes, but also have pairs of ASCIS, Puma, New Balance, and Nike and haven't had any similar issues."

    "selftext": "Male, 26 years old 5\u20198\u201d 150 lbs, wide flat feet Men\u2019s 9.5, mild heel strike\n**Justification for the shoe and use case: Similar to my Hyperion 2 GTS review I was dealing with post tibial tendonitis and wanted to explore some stability options in racing shoes. For now, 10k to half marathon but if my 10 mile at marathon pace goes well, possibly the marathon this May.\n**First Run\nI wanted to use this for an interval session at threshold. I usually warmup and do this at Maffetone HR of 154 HR for 10 minutes and normally on the hyperion, it would fall at 5:45/km. With this shoe it was just rolling me along with crazy snap and bounce. It was making me go at 5:15/km. After that I did 3x10min, 1min rest at threshold. Each rep I was somehow dropping 4:00/km (180 cadence) and 3:50/km (190) on the last 3. With the hyperion 2 they would be 4:30/km and 4:15/km.\n**Is this shoe really only for elites?\n Honestly with these first impressions, it boosts my performance while not feeling harsh and I'm not an elite. I was scared off by that from reviewers and they say how stiff the shoe is. However after owning the Saucony Tempus 1, there can be a difference between stiff and harsh. The tempus was stiff, harsh and performed around the same as the hyperion.\n**Who is this shoe for?\nI think if you like stiff shoes and want stability in your super shoe. To me it feels like a stability meta speed edge paris. The edge paris was way too unstable for me.\n**Fit, Upper, Laces, Grip\nOk so this was on sale and I took the risk to get a women's size 11 which is equivalent to a men's size 9.5. I couldn't find any information on the width but the elite is a wide shoe in general and if the women's were to be narrower it would have been fine because the meta speed edge paris is a narrow fit but I fit that men's 9.5. The fit ended up being perfect. Has half a thumbs width to the front and pinky toes were not hitting the sides. At times my right pinky toe would get sore in the edge paris. Upper, I can't say much but I don't notice any rubbing. I also can't just put the shoe in directly like say the hyperion 2, I need to untie and tie them. Laces: I guess they're ok...? They don't have the sawtooth pattern like the hyperion or alphafly. Grip: Seems fine, I was going speeds faster than I ever did and I didn't feel like slipping on the track.",

And they are sublime, my absolute favorite shoe for the marathon so far. By a wide margin. Yes, exceptionally soft. And also very fast and efficient at any pace I've tried.\n\nThe fit is very similar to the Saucony Endorphin Elite 1, which is mostly generous yet well held. The toe box is a bit less spacious than the 1, but only by the most marginal amount. Other than that, fit and hold are exceptional both through the midfoot and the heel. I came out of my marathon without a hint of a hot spot or blister or black toenail. My toes aren't even sore. The ride is weirdly forgiving. Run with pace, and it offers pace back. Run easier, and it rolls along efficiently and protectively. Get up on your toes, and you fly. Tire a bit and fall back on the heels, you still fly. Explosive, yet easy going.\n\nI would name two cons, one itsy bitsy and one small (but potential a bigger deal on certain courses.) The itsy bitsy one, the toe bumper is pretty stiff. For a few minutes during my race, I noticed what felt like my toes bumping against it. The noticing was there and gone so quickly I barely remembered it. The small con, this shoe is super soft. Corners are not its strength. My marathon course had two 180 degree turns and I had to be very deliberate about navigating them. But then the shoe becomes surprisingly stable while moving in a straight line, so it's really only a problem through tighter corners. And a third consideration, the foam is so soft that I can occasionally feel the plate on the forefoot. It's not uncomfortable or problematic, just a surprising sensation of firmness in all this pillowy softness. I only noticed this occasionally in training, not at all during my race.\n\nFast, efficient, protective, wildly comfortable, and now my PR shoe. What's not to love! I'll be buying another pair for the Chicago Marathon next year once the shoe fully drops. This shoe is special! Like the first time putting the Nike OG Vaporfly 4% on back in 2017/2018.\n\nPerhaps helpful notes about myself to make the review more meaningful: 6'1\", 170lbs, 2:54 marathon PR, 70ish miles per week on average, alternate between mountain ultramarathons and road marathons every six months wear size 11.5 in most shoes. Other supershoes I've used: OG Vaporfly, Vaporfly Next 1, Alphafly 1 & 2, adidas Adios Pro 2 & 3, Saucony Endorphin Pro 1 & 3, Saucony Endorphin Elite 1, Puma Deviate Nitro Elite 1, adidas Prime X 1 & 1 Strung & 2 Strung.",

    "selftext": "\u2022\tShoe Model & Size: - Saucony Triumph 22 11.5 US Men\u2019s\n\n\u2022\tFit/Comfort Notes:\u00a0I have fairly flat feet and have worn arch supports in the past. These shoes fit me perfectly right out of the box, and were much more comfortable without insoles than with. My feet are also pretty wide and I have struggled with other brands to get shoes that are an appropriate width (Nike in particular) These are great for my feet and I occasionally wear them to work because they\u2019re so comfortable. \n\n\u2022\tUse Case:\u00a0Daily Trainer (not race shoe)\n\n\u2022\tDistance Ran:\u00a0510 miles\n\n\u2022\tReason For Buying:\u00a0I wanted a stiffer shoe after exclusively running in Hokas. When my last pair got shredded I decided to change it up and found these to be the most comfortable for my gait right out of the box. \n\n\u2022\tProfile: 5\u20199, 153, Heel/Mid Striker. Run about 35 MPW around 7:40 min/mile\n\n\u2022\tPros: These are by far the most durable shoes I\u2019ve ever worn. 500 miles in and there is only some minor wear on the soles. They still are plenty springy and comfortable, and feel pretty close to how they did when I purchased them. They have withstood rain and snow with no trouble. I suspect they\u2019re good for at least another 200 miles. They are fairly versatile as well - I have run long distances (17+ mi) in them and found the extra cushioning to be very useful. However, when training for races they still feel responsive enough to make fast paces feel comfortable.\n\n\u2022\tCons: Can feel a bit soggy when running at race pace. I would definitely never wear them for an actual race. \n\n\u2022\tShoe comparisons:  \n\t\u2043\tHoka Clifton - The durability difference between these two is not even close - he soles on my Hokas were completely worn after 230 miles. The Hoka\u2019s were comfortable but lacked the springiness/responsiveness of the Triumphs. \n\t\u2043\tBrooks Glycerin GTS - I ran a couple times in these and found them to be much too stiff for my liking right out of the gate. \n\t\u2043\tSaucony Endorphin Pro 3 - Obviously a completely different shoe. I train in the Triumphs and race in the Endorphins and find that the transition is a good fit for me. These have a much lighter weight and provide much more bounce due to the carbon plate. \n\t\u2043\tSaucony Triumph 21 - I recently bought these to see if they\u2019d be a suitable replacement for the 22\u2019s and found them to be much too stiff for my liking. There is a noticeable increase in cushion in the 22, especially in the heel. I suppose for some this could make the 22 feel clunky, but I prefer it to the 21. \n\nTL;DR: Barring any unforeseen changes, I will probably never buy another training shoe again! These shoes rock and have given me the most bang for my buck of any shoe I\u2019ve worn.",

    "selftext": "Background: I am a 17m, I run 15:35 for 5k, 35:43 for 10k, and 76:40 for the half. I have been running for about 3 years and I forefoot/midfoot striker. I have had experience with the VF2, VF3, TS9 and the Metaspeed Sky Paris, my current race shoe\n\nUpper: This is honestly the weak point of the shoe, it is no where near as comfortable as the VF3. I experienced some pain on the outside of my foot for most of the run. I had similar issues with the TS9, but after I broke in the upper those issues went away, so I would expect similar things here. Heel lock down, and foot security in general is also pretty good, it's a decently padded heel collar and I had no issues with heel slip or rubbing on my Achilles. One final note, Nike has gotten ride of the saw tooth laces and now use some sort of stretchy laces which aren't great, very similar to those on the AP4 imo.\n\nRide: I took these out for 10 x 400 at mile pace. I'll be blunt, these things are absolute rockets. The best way to describe it is a cross of the TS9 and the Sky Paris. They are super snappy through toe off, the rocker isn't super noticeable but they have the fast, snappy turnover the TS9 have. The foam is pretty similar to the Sky Paris, hence the comparison. It works super well to add a little bounce on toe off, something I thought the VF3 was missing. It also doesn't bottom out like the VF3 or Sky Paris. However, I am pretty light so heavier runners might struggle with bottoming out. Another headliner for this shoe is the weight and slightly lower stack height (35mm). I definitely felt the weight, it helped massively with the turnover. The stack is not super noticeable though in my opinion, the foam is so soft and bouncy the road kinda gets tuned out. It has less ground feel than the VF 3 so I would expect people will have no problem taking these up to the marathon.\n\nOutsole: Nothing to write about, maybe a little less grippy than the 3, but not a super noticeable amount. Nike has kept the same out sole layout as before, a little more akin to the VF2 than 3 though. It definitely won't have issues on any of the terrain in the typical road race. However, I think durability could be a huge issue, especially in the heel. I am already seeing decent wear in the heel rubber patches. However, the exposed foam is holding up fine, surprisingly.\n\nVerdict and Comparisons: These are a great update to the VF line. They fix most of the issues of the VF3, aside from the stability. The ride is far more aggressive and exciting which I think people will appreciate over the more analogue ride of the 3 or the super mechanical ride of the AF3 (they are fun though). Other than the upper and laces, these are truly spectacular and would probably be my race day pick at the moment.\n\n9.5/10\n\n[Side view \\(very pretty imo\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ywxh4ewybzme1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b248f240147cb7c320ba4b3b0d2dfd80fe3d2dfa)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z6c6dgwybzme1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9027ac77b3509a9f7399a7e0d8c6cbeddf7c117d\n\n[Outsole](https://preview.redd.it/56ps7fwybzme1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4efbb102109605b99f5baea44b971f77a5f7079)",

    "title": "Neo Vista at 250 miles/400 km",
    "selftext": "Context: I\u2019m a heavier runner, around 190 lbs/86 kg. Hybrid athlete-type. After a few years of running and a lot of fun 13.1\u2013and-under racing, I\u2019m currently in the peak week for my first marathon on March 29.\n\nI picked up the Neo Vista last fall because, honestly, I thought it looked really cool. Weird, but cool. I still feel this way. It feels like it comes from outer space, and apparently that\u2019s the aesthetic I seek when browsing running websites.\n\nAnyway, I wanted a nice long run shoe to help me through the increasing weekly miles, and the Neo Vista has proven itself to be SO MUCH MORE than \u201cjust\u201d my long run workhorse.\nI\u2019m feeling like lately there is this emerging idea that the Neo Zen is better than the Vista, that it takes what the NV does well and offers it in a more streamlined and cost-effective package. I\u2019m not here to argue that, as I haven\u2019t had the pleasure of running in a NZ yet. But I do want to give the NV some love, because BOY does it deserve it.\n\nThe Neo Vista, for me, hits that exact sweet spot between fun and cushion. It\u2019s so supple and comfortable, with stack for days, but it also almost always feels like it wants you to pick up the pace a little bit. For 80% of my runs, that\u2019s exactly what I want: to feel like I could go faster if I wanted to, but at a nice low tempo pace I can just cruise for hours.\n\nIt\u2019s not a particularly aggressive shoe, but I have speed day shoes I whip out for those moments. But when you open up the hips and let it rip, the Neo Vista is VERY happy to oblige.\nIt is not a good recovery day shoe, I will say that. The insane stack and pillowy landings might suggest it, but its geometry is just not set up for very slow paces. I find anything over 9:30/mile (5:54/km) is pretty hard to maintain in these.\n\nAnyway, about that geometry. I\u2019ve settled into a super neutral, really comfortable midfoot strike with these that I love. The shoe just rolls me through and pops me forward so effortlessly. It really does feel like the shoe makes me run better, mechanically.\n\nAs you can tell from the wear on the outsole, I\u2019ve got a bit of supination going on. But that\u2019s always an issue for me due to high arches. Stability-wise, the NV took a little getting used to (especially in corners). It\u2019s the highest-stack shoe I\u2019ve run in, so I had to get used to that feeling of being so high off the ground. But now that I\u2019m used to it I find it to be a very stable neutral shoe; I even run trails with it from time to time!\n\nThat\u2019s actually why my \u201cold\u201d pair is covered in mud today: I was having so much fun on my 10-miler yesterday I decided to slosh through some trails on the way back.\n\nTo that end, the outsole grip is wild on these. They have seen me through a New England winter, taken me through Montreal during a snowstorm, run on sandy beach paths in Florida, and everything in between. I haven\u2019t lost traction a single time.\n\nAnyway, all this is to say that I\u2019ve decided to run my first marathon in them. I\u2019d been planning on picking up a super shoe, but I love these super trainers too much to abandon them at the start line. I picked up a second pair in that sick (also slightly ridiculous) oni colorway, and I\u2019ll be phasing them in over the coming weeks so they\u2019re nice and broken in for the marathon.\n\nBut my old pair is still feeling AMAZING after 250 miles of hard marathon training. Maybe a tiny bit less explosive, but honestly I can\u2019t really feel it. I guess I\u2019ll know once I take the new pair out.\n\nGiven how well they\u2019ve held up, I can easily see myself saving these for easier long days and taking them to 500 miles/800 km.\n\nMaybe if I do a second marathon I\u2019ll go the super shoe route, who knows? But for now, I feel very happy having these trusty, ridiculous, wonderful shoes strapped to my feet. I know they\u2019ll see me through, and I know they\u2019ll put a smile on my face.",

    "title": "Topo Cyclone 2: My thoughts after 800km",
    "selftext": "Just yesterday I finally reached 800kms, after buying them in July 2023. Me: M21, 54kg, 167cm. Mostly racing HM (\\~1:25 PB), sometimes Marathons (\\~3:05 PB).\n\n# Usage\n\nI bought them as a replacement for my daily trainers, which at that time were Hoka Mach 5s. This is also how I used them: Mostly easy runs, some longer, some quicker, but nothing too special. My longest run in them was around 21kms and my fastest a 5k race; the average pace in them over the 800km is 5:39/km.\n\n# Fit\n\nI usually wear EU42 in most brands, sometimes even 42.5 if they are tight in the forefoot. The Cyclone is a very wide and accomodating shoe and I should have sized down to 41.5.\n\nI sometimes have problems with my achilles in some shoes and usually wear orthopedic insoles; here I did not have to do that because of the special insoles by Topo and I never had any problem with it.\n\n# Performance\n\nI feel like the Cyclone 2 performed pretty well as a daily trainer. Straight out of the box, I found them not too bouncy and not too much fun, but they were a stable shoe in my rotation that I could rely on. Actually, maybe it was good that they were not inviting me to go too fast.\n\nThe ride did not change much over time (at least I can't really tell) and they did not bottom out. I never had any issues with them feeling more lifeless than usual ;)\n\nIn the cases were I did speed up, they also served me very well. They are lightweight and feel pretty fast, minus a carbon (stiff) plate.\n\nIn my longest run in them I did notice the \"low\" stackheight afterwards. My feet felt more beaten up than in other shoes, but I don't think they are made for this anyway and they certainly did not hold me back.\n\n# How they held up\n\nThe upper held up fine! The mid- and outsole look a bit more run down, as is expected. The outsole held up until 700kms, that was when I started to run on foam (at least on the lateral side).\n\nWhat I just noticed is that on the left shoe, the upper has dissolved(?) a bit. Probably the result of the shoe being to large for me, so it bent more than usual in that spot.\n\nI retired them now due to the outsole rubber dissolving at the front / middle and them being slippery when not on pavement.\n\nThe rubber at the heel is still as new, so I will get some more time out of them when walking.\n\n# Would I buy them again?\n\nNo, but that is because I don't buy shoes twice, unless they are really something special ;)\n\nI think for their relaitvely low price, they are a pretty versatile and reliable shoe with great value. Now I will use them as my regular walking shoes until my next daily trainer is retired.\n\n# Comparisons\n\n* Hoka Mach 5: The Mach 5 is way more bouncy and fun; but I found it bottomed out after \\~500kms. The Cyclones are much more comfortable to wear though.\n\n* Evo SL: Same deal as with the Mach 5: Evo Sl = fun; Cyclone = comfortable to wear.\n\n* New Balance Rebel v4: I feel like the Rebel is actually relatively close to the Cyclone. This will be my replacement.\n\n* Hoka Mach 6: Also the same deal as with the Mach 5.\n\n* Asics Novablast 3: Overall kinda similar, but for me the Novablasts felt worse in all regards. They were not very comfortable or versatile and I choose to sell them pretty quick. Cyclone all the way!\n\nIf you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them!",

      "Sample size 1, but my Cyclone 2's had an outsole start to peel off after only 80 miles. Im a 110 lb runner, used them exclusively on non-technical smooth paths and roads, and stored them in a closet away from UV exposure. Because they were 14 months old, Topo basically told me they couldn't do anything and gave me a 20% off full-price shoes coupon code, which is basically worthless to me since I only buy shoes on sale.\n\nI liked them, but they've lost a customer at least for road shoes. My Endorphin Speed 3's have lasted longer, feel more stable, and feel faster.",
      "Looking at a daily trainer, got a more v4 for real slow and takuki sens/endorphin speeds for tempo/intervals\n\nSo looking for something that fits the easy tag, low drop, just below threshold running.\n\nHad a pair of novablasts, not breathable upper and poor grip aside, they fit the bill for a couple kms then bottomed out and created foot pain that makes them useless for me.\n\nBeen looking at mach 6, cyclone 3, torin 8, evol sl and neo zens as potentials.\n\nMach 6 i was worried about the heel countet but sounded good overall\n\nEvo sl grip seems a little suspect and might be too aggressive?\n\nCyclone only concern is the arch support, not sure if that will be an issue\n\nTorin 8 seems decent but zero drop and seems like people suggest also more fast focused\n\nNeo zen maybe too slow\n\nYou have used half of these, any views on which fit that bill?",
      "Cyclone 2 is going to be my next purchase (with my feet, basically Topo and the new Inov8 lineup are the only ones that truly fit my foot), so I was excited to see your review.

      "Can anyone help me understand Nike's lineup? I feel like I could always count on buying the next pegasus when I need to replace the old one. Now, there are like four different versions, they are pretty close in pricing, there is vomero that I haven't tried but people seem to like... I'm just overwhelmed.\n\n  \n\n\nWhat I like about the pegasus is I feel like I get good support, but I can still feel the road underneath me. I like my novablasts, but they feel wider, almost too supportive. I'm not sure if they are actually heavier than the pegasus or not, but they feel it.",

I settled on these after trying various different shoes and they fit my needs perfectly for the type of running that I do. \n\nIt's finally time to buy new shoes, and the current generation Nimbus/Cumulus look completely different than the 24s. Just looking for some advice on whether the current Nimbus or Cumulus would better suit my needs or whether I should start looking for a different shoe. Thanks in advance.",
      "Got my first half marathon ever this May and I decided to run it on my Superblast 1s. I love love how it peppy and bouncy it felt. I have around 60km on it and I definitely feel it being more broken in. It felt considerably softer but I definitely still could do a faster long run or even race sim with no issue.\n\nMy question is, should I save my Superblast until my race? I\u2019m worried it would soften up further and \u201close its pep\u201d. I know the SBs are notoriously durable and could go for hundreds of miles but still \ud83d\ude02 maybe I\u2019m just overthinking it",

    "title": "Asics Novablast 5 inital thoughts after 30 miles (Comparing to Succony Triumph 20/21)",
    "selftext": "My specs:\n\n\\- 6ft 2in\n\n\\- 170lbs/77kg\n\n\\- Paces ran using this shoe: Moderate/easy pace 7:30-9:00min/mi or 4:40 - 5:35 min/km\n\n\\- Mid striker\n\nI bought this shoe in my usual size 11, fits very well with a wider toe box for me toes which I appreciate. First impressions in the Asics store was how insanely soft the foam was. \n\nMy hopes for this shoe was that it would be a good recovery shoe and a good long run shoe that I could rotate with my beloved Succony Triumph 20 (retired at 600mi/965km) and 21.\n\nAfter running in these shoes for about 30 miles now I think it's an incredibly fun shoe. The midsole is super bouncy and surprisingly stable. HOWEVER for me the bouncy-ness and the soft cushion starts to flatten out for me after around 6mi/10k. And I'd usually let the shoe rest after the run for at least a day or two for the foam to decompress and for the next run it'll have it's bouncy ride again. Has anyone with the NB5 noticed this with their pair? Idk if it's just my feet are getting tired because they start to hurt in these shoes after said distance. Or maybe I'm too heavy for the shoe?\n\nHow does the NB5 compare to my Triumph 20/21?\n\nIn terms of ride I thought the Triumphs were bouncy but the NB5 is noticeably bouncier and softer. However as I've said the NB5 starts to bottom out and lose bounce during my longer runs. My Triumphs on the other hand, the foam while soft, is firmer then the NB5, and keeps it's nice cushioned ride throughout the entirety of my long runs. \n\nOutsole: the Triumph outsole is a tank, 600mi my Triumph 20s and it now my walking shoe. It's too early to tell but from what I heard I don't think these NB5 can even come close to lasting as long as my Triumph 20. In terms of grip, I've ran with Triumphs in the rain and had no problems with grip until like 500-550miles or so when my treads were starting to go flat. Can't really speak for the NB5, been running with them in dry conditions but I've heard wet grip isn't the best in the NB5.\n\nUpper: NB5 wins here, it's light and very breathable, with my Triumph it has a slightly bulky upper can get a bit hot but still comfortable.\n\nPlans for the NB5, will probably use this shoe for easy runs less than 6mi/10k. In terms of pace it can handle easy slow paces well, but when running at a more moderate  pace is when I really feel more of bouncy-ness of the shoe making it super fun to run in. \n\nOverall a great shoe, was a bit disappointed on how it handled my long run but other than that fun shoe!\n\n",

      "for me i feel the softness and not really the bounce, have about 180km in it so far",
      "I can't imagine what it's like to be a skinny runner that weighs less than 140lbs with all these super bouncy foams...if they feel somewhat bouncy to me at 180, I'm betting it's an entirely different experience for the lighter folk",
      "I have run in Novablasts since Asics introduced them. Generally speaking, there are very few complaints about these shoes from those who have owned them, but I have found that they seem to compress significantly and lose some of the initial magic after about 150-200 miles. They are not worn out, but as an older guy with tons of miles in my rear view, my forefoot pain increases at about this point. I mention this wondering if some of the other max cushion shoes retain their softness through more miles. Also, getting them wet seems to pretty dramatically affect the cushion. Just my thoughts, not trying to start a flame war. 5\"10\"\", 180 here. 8-9 minute miles.",
      "I have around 200k with mine.\n\nI felt they needed a solid 70-80k to break in nicely.\nNow they feel consistent thorough the run. So far my longest run was 1h30 (urban trail 16k)\n\nBut agree the first km where weird. I felt like two pods on the point of the shoes for the first 20k"

    "title": "Adios Pro 4 - Initial Thoughts Review After HM Race",
    "selftext": "**Total distance ran:** 23 miles / 37 km\n**My profile:** M32, 184 cm (6 ft), 79 kg (174 lbs), UK 9, forefoot striker\n**Type of runs:** First run 10 miles, 1km on, 1km off workout to get a feel for HM pace. Second run full on half marathon race.\n**Weather ran in:** Training run in heavy downpour around 10\u00b0C. Race around 3-4\u00b0C dry with icy patches.\n\n---\n\n**Positives:**\n\n- Very good energy return from the foam.\n- Rod system propulsive, but with a bit of torsion flex which is welcome.\n- Does not dictate unnatural mechanics.\n- Breathable upper. Dries quickly after rain as well.\n- Gusseted tongue - easy to put on.\n- Easy to clean.\n- Very good grip.\n- Geometry feels familiar after training in Evo SL.\n- Pricing - bought for \u00a3185 on launch.\n- Very good looking.\n\n---\n\n**Negatives:**\n\n- Lacing system improved from AP3, but still poor.\n- Instant lace bite issues if tied slightly too tight.\n- Heel counter poorly designed - major achilles irritation issues.\n- Very unstable in tight corners.\n\n---\n\n**Context for buying:**\n\nI bought these for my spring marathon. I am aiming for 3:45 finish. Today was my 'B' race - a half marathon where I aimed for a 1:40 finish and finished in 1:40. Previous HM PB was 1:43 in the Vaporfly 3. \n\nPreviously raced in: Vaporfly 3, Vaporfly 2 and Alphafly 1. I tried quite a few other racing shoes such as Adios Pro 3, Endorphin Pro 3 and others but they didn't work for me and I sold them on very promptly.\n\nI like a bouncy midsole where I can land on the forefoot and bounce right off. My perfect idea of a race shoe was always the OG Alphafly. I am still looking for a worthy replacement but nothing came close so far.\n\nI bought the shoes on the same day as the Evo SL but kept them in a box until last week. This review is my initial thoughts after one 10 mile workout and the HM race. I am not yet decided if I will take them for the full marathon distance - to be decided in a 20 mile long run soon.\n\n---\n\n**Upper, fit and comfort:**\n\nI will start by saying that I am normally a UK 9 in most running shoes, including the Evo SL. I initially ordered a UK 9 but found it too small. Only then I looked at the sizing chart to find that with Adidas the UK 9 translates to US 9.5 and not US 10 which I'm used to. If we went by the UK sizing, I'd say I had to size up. If we go by US sizing, I went TTS.\n\nThe fit is very much a race fit. I have narrow feet and felt very snug. Folks with wider feet will likely find this shoe too narrow.\n\nUpper is made of a nice breathable material. On my first run I got completely soaked and then dried in repeat downpours about three times. No sloshy feeling or soaking up water. Water escaped and the shoes and dried as soon as it got wet. They got quite muddy as well but to my surprise the white fabric didn't stain at all. I cleaned them under the sink with a toothbrush in 2 minutes and they looked brand new at all. Very welcome surprise as I was worried about getting them all muddy on the first run.\n\nUnfortunately it all goes downhill from here. The lacing, although improved from AP3 which I just couldn't run in, is still quite bad. This morning during my pre-race warm up I had to stop about 4 or 5 times to re-do the laces. It takes the tiniest movement to go from \"too loose, shoes escape from under my feet\" to \" too tight, my feet hurt from the laces\". Very, very fine balancing game. On my first run I got lace bite so this time I made sure I didn't screw up as I knew I wouldn't have a chance to stop and adjust mid-race. In the end it was fine but I had to heel lock one of the shoes.\n\nNext major flaw is the heel counter (see pic 3). Material bunching up, visible stitching against the back of the heel. On first run I felt a bit of irritation but as my laces were tighter it wasn't so much of an issue. During the race this shredded my achilles and left painful marks on my skin. Not to blood which is why I'm still giving them a chance for the marathon, but not great either. I don't understand why Adidas and Nike continue to design heel counters like this. I'd much prefer to have the Evo SL heel counter on the Pro 4.\n\nAlso the red fabric stained my white socks which at first I thought was blood, but it turned out to be  dye from the heel counter.\n\nAdidas still have a lot of work to do in the upper department. The changes were welcome but this upper is not necessarily something I'd want to wear for a marathon.\n\n---\n\n**Midsole:**\n\nThis is my facourite part of this shoe. I found the AP3 a bit dull. They were fast but nothing to write home about. This foam feels completely different. Softer, more bouncy. It now pairs very well with the rod system. If you remember my review of Evo SL, I very much enjoyed the fun ride, but complained about lack of directional rebound. This is completely remedied in the Pro 4. The foam works in perfect harmony with the rods to provide a fun, bouncy ride but also propels you forward in a nice, predictable way.\n\nThe ride of the shoe felt very natural for a supershoe of this caliber. I often feel that the modern supershoes try to dictate how you run an put excess stress on certain muscle groups. I felt no such thing in these shoes. My legs feel very fresh regardless of just doing an all out half and being in middle of a marathon block. Very positive. It would benefit from something simillar to the Nike's air pod under the forefoot to add extra bounce but one can only dream.\n\nMy only gripe is that on the out and back part of the route at the turn around point, I almost lost balance. Very unstable in tight corners. Slow down and take it easy if you don't want to hurt your ankles. Shouldn't be an issue in big races without tight corners though.\n\n---\n\n**Outsole:**\n\nVery funny suction feeling initially. They literally feel like sucking in on some flat surfaces. Only felt this while walking and during warm up. It disappeared when I picked up the pace.\n\nNo issues on wet tarmac. Also no issues on a few icy patches this morning. Very solid and trustworthy outsole. No visible wear so far either.\n\n---\n\n**Worth buying?**\n\nGenerally yes. Great value at \u00a3185, even at RRP I'd say it's a good value race shoe. The upper is still annoying but bearable unlike the AP3 was. If only they fixed the annoying lacing and heel counter, this model would be an absolute banger.\n\nAdditionally, the combo of Evo SL and AP4 presents a great marathon training offering at the combined price of \u00a3350 which is much less than other brands.",

    "selftext": "Contextuals:\nI am a 190lbs mid/forefoot striker. I have taken both shoes out for a variety of runs and paces. Why these two? They have a similar place in the market with similar technologies in place. Longest run in the Peg+ was 16km and 24km in the Evo SL. \n\nBoth shoes have a minimum of 50km in them. \n\nMy marathon PB is 3:28 and I have run a 20:04 5K. \n\nThe Ride:\nPegasus Plus: \nIn a word...ground feel, which is not what I was expecting from this shoe. It mostly is a result of the 10mm drop(hate) making the forefoot a lower stack in a soft foam. The heel feels much firmer than the forefoot so it may work for heelstrikers. The shoe had a break in period, kinda hated it during said period. \n\nEvo SL:\nFlexible Adios Pro 3. That's the pitch. Everything you love about the Adios Pro 3 but no rods or carbon making it more flexible in the midsole and ludicrously bouncy and energetic. Wildly fun to run at all paces in. \"Endless Foam\" is the best description I have heard. \n\nWinner: Evo SL.\n\nUpper/Lockdown:\nPegasus Plus: \nFirst experience with Flyknit and I am a fan after a fashion. Probably my favorite part of the shoe. Drains great in wet weather, breathes wonderfully, and holds the foot in place well. Heelcounter is stout and well padded around the ankle. No issues after my first run dialing it in. Tongue is good but slides around just a little bit. \n\nEvo SL: \nBreathable, and comfortable. It is nothing to write home about and scrunches a bit on the sides but you don't notice it once you are on the run. Locks down well, strategic passing around the ankle and a significantly better heelcup than the Pro 3 but that is not a tall bar to clear. Tongue is great so shimmies or sliding around for me, no lace bite, one of the best tongues from the Adidas Adizero line. (Again not a tall bar to clear). \n\nWinner: Pegasus Plus.\n\nPrice Point:\nPegasus Plus: \ud83d\ude2c\n\nEvo SL:\nCheaper than the Endorphin Speed 4 and more bang for you buck. \n\nWinner: Evo SL.\n\nOutsole:\nPegasus Plus:\nHigh Abrasion rubber, it is holding up well to the wear and tear I tend to lay down. They are a little louder than I prefer from my running shoes but I have not had any issues on sandy sidewalks,, rain, and sunshine. \n\nEvo SL:\nContinental Rubber, same setup as the Pro 3 so if you know you know. Lasts forever, great in all conditions you will encounter road running. Great grip cornering at pace and does not lose traction when I am really digging my toes in. \n\nWinner: Tie. They both perform well and I wont hold the slappyness of the Peg against it.\n\nOverall Winner: Evo SL",

    "selftext": "\nMale, 26 years old 5\u20198\u201d 150 lbs, wide flat feet Men\u2019s 9.5, mild heel strike \n\n\n**What I use this shoe for: \nMainly Intervals on the track, easy runs, daily walking - I think they look great for casual wear \n\n\n**Justification for the shoe: \nI was suffering from post tibial tendonitis on my right ankle because I was being reckless on the track using super shoes like the Saucony Endorphin Pro 3 doing 8x1000m, 1min:30s with some reps being at 3k, 5k pace as opposed to 10k pace. \nHaving a bouncy platform at speed under fatigue is not doing me any favours for excessive pronation.\n\nBring in the Hyperion 2 GTS: lower to the ground at 27mm, has the GTS guide rails, light weight around 7.5 oz in my size \n\n\n**First Run:\n8x1000m at the track, 1min:30s rest \nFirst 6 reps at 10k pace 4:40/km\nLast 2 reps at 3k pace? 4:15/km \nThese reps are around 178 cadence and 185 for the last two.  \n\nThey felt amazing! I think it has the good amount of bounce and surprisingly little ground feel as opposed to say a Takumi Sen 10. \nThe feeling of the foam felt like light strike pro in the Sen and Adios Pro 3 so on the stiffer side. However due to the rods in those they feel snappier for sure. \nThe stability is great too! If it\u2019s not aggravating the pain on the medial side that tells me it\u2019s reducing the pronation in contrast to the Sen which is unstable and gives pain in that area.\n\n\n**Compared to other plateless shoes I used:\nSaucony Tempus: The other stability tempo option. I ended up returning them. They felt harsh to me for easy runs and track intervals for some reason. Very stiff ride that gave the sensation my shins were gonna be in pain and made my right arch sore doing an easy run.\nTopo Cyclone 2: Despite having similar stack height of 27mm the cyclone definitely has more noticeable ground feel and cyclone is more flexible. \n\n\n**Who is this shoe for?\nThose who want a light weight, lower to the ground shoe and want stability for tempo and interval workouts. Id imagine like the new balance rebel v3 it would be fantastic on the treadmill. \n\n\n**Fit, Upper, Laces, Grip\nLiterally fits perfect, big toe has at least a thumbs width of space and pinky toes don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re banging on the side. The upper looks good and heel collar allows you to just put the shoe in right away laced up. In contrast to the Sen I need to untie and tie to get it in. Laces are like the alphafly laces so a 10/10 for that. Haven\u2019t tested this for rain but it feels grippy. \n\n\n\n\n",

      "I had already given up on regular D width shoes because my feet just don't work with them as I have 2E feet + high volume insteps. My true feet size is 8.0 2E but I go atleast 8.5 2E for my shoes. In regular width shoes, I have to go up to 9.5 D just to not have crammed toebox. Even then, the midfoot feels incredibly snug. The regular width shoes that I have ran in all ended up giving me foot numbness (Saucony ES4, Topo Specter 2). Another problem that also arises is that with 1.5 sizes up, these shoes also run long for me now and give really bad heel slip.\n\nBUT! There seems to be a shoe that defies that now. Although I gave up on regular width shoes, I still try them on cuz I guess I like to torture and tease myself with shoes that I know will never work for me. I tried on the Mizuno Neo Zen at the store today and WOW, this might be the first ever regular width shoe that might actually work for me fit-wise. I never thought it would ever happen, but even at size 9.0 D this shoe actually still runs quite spacious (1.25 thumbs width) AND I dont feel snug on the midfoot. Not only that, this is the first shoe I've tried where the heel feels secure, but still comfortable, on top of everything else. Even for my 2E wide shoes I have a little bit of heel slip with them since I have narrower heel.\n\nI might end up pulling the trigger to try running this shoe"

      "A few weeks ago I read some advice people posted about the Saucony Echelon 9. I am not a runner but I was having extreme difficulty finding any pair of shoes that fit due to having a wide foot that didn't even fit into most conventional 4E shoes. After trying on what felt like hundreds of shoes at stores and finding nothing and thus becoming a bit depressed over it I started investigating and I found this forum where everyone said this was one of the widest shoes on the market. This shoe is not easy to find in stores so I found a pair on amazon. The price was $111 on sale and my wallet liked that price for a high quality pair of shoes. I ordered the 4E version and it worked out great. I am pleased to say I like the shoes when no other shoes fit my feet, and I obviously cannot go without shoes. For this I am very grateful to this forum for making suggestions for this pair of Saucony shoes.",
      "Am I the only person who loves the Kinvara 14's?  Seem to take a lot of heat, but I've picked up a few pairs for \\~$60, and basically use them as my everyday running shoe.  Super light, a bit snappy. Can even work for tempo in a pinch.  I transitioned from minimalist, so maybe I'm a bit off when it comes to my judgment, and I've never used a super soft trainer.",
      "About 250 miles into the Saucony Omni 21. It's built like a tank but feels more like a brick. It feels firm with not a lot of  give. Just wanted to know if this was anyone else's experience!",
      "Is anyone going to pick up the Endorphin Trainer. I still have some life left in my Kinvara Pro but want to try the Endorphin Trainer.",
      "Personally Triumph 20/21 as of currently is the best long run shoe ever. I done 650 miles on my Triumph 20s before I had to retire them and it's replaced with a fresh pair of 21s hoping it'll do the same. Triumph 22 from what I heard rides worse than it's previous iterations.\n\nHaven't been able to find another shoe it rides the same as the Triumph 20/21, I just got the Asics Novablast 5s while it's a fun shoe to run in because of the bounce; I find the foam too soft for long runs and starts to bottom out for me little 10k-12k in my runs. And I'd have to let the shoe rest for a day or two for the foam to uncompress. Never really had that issue in the Triumph 20/21 used to run in them everyday until I actually had a rotation."

      "I really wish Asics would do the magic speed 5 like they did the magic speed 3 but with a layer of FF Blast max. Such a good shoe for interval/vo2 max and threshold runs.

      "Picked up a pair of Superblast 2 last week. Thoughts after 3 10k runs:  \n\\- They are super fun to cruise in at medium pace, maybe my all time favourite shoe for that.  \n\\- It's nice that the upper is generous by Asics standards. I couldn't run in some of the Novablasts because they were too narrow.  \n\\- The upper runs a bit hot. I'm in Bangkok at 30-35C so definitely not representative for most people, but my feet get above average sweaty in these  \n\\- I'm getting a bit of achilles chafing, have fixed this by taping it up under my socks.  \n\\- Also getting a bit of pain in the lateral midfoot, only for the first 1-3km and then it goes away\n\nEven though I listed 1 pro and 4 cons, I like these a lot. The ride is just a ton of fun. You can go easy in them, and then when you pick up the pace they come alive.",
      "Glideride Max I purchased after many positive reviews here and just about everywhere else. I\u2019ve clicked over 50km in my pair and I\u2019m feeling stumped by this shoe? Upper feels tight (despite trying three separate ways of lacing), yet even with the runner\u2019s loop my foot is sliding inside the shoe? I feel like I have no connection with the shoe and my foot and it\u2019s feeling dangerous to run anything but flats with them. Does anyone have any insights or experience with this?"
